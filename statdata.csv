0,Aer Lingus,3,"""Worst lack of care""","We flew Aer Lingus last summer Seattle to Dublin to Edinburgh and then back Edinburg to Dublin to Seattle. Our plane left quite late from Seattle with no explanation and we ended up getting into Dublin several hours late missing our connecting flight. No one there to help, an hour bouncing around to different Aer Lingus staff in the arrival terminal w/o one person helping us. We finally ended up outside back at check-in in a long line of rebooking passengers who were told we wouldn’t make the next Edinburgh flight as it was booked, last one out that day. The staff were unwilling to book us on Ryan Air which EU regulations say should happen as they had plenty of seats. A supervisor took pity on me and somehow got me on the last flight but we arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours or more late outside of the EU regulations with no food or drink offered or available. Aer Lingus has denied the EU regulation payment saying it’s not covered since  unforeseen circumstances on first rejection and then it was a us domestic originated flight so it isn’t covered (not true since it started in Dublin and arrived late into the States). On flight to Dublin they lost my wife’s suitcase and it didn’t get to us until the 2nd to last day in Ireland, over 72 hours when it’s considered a lost bag, we filed a claim, and not once has anyone acknowledged this reimbursement owed for the modest clothing she had to buy.

5,Aer Lingus,7,"""would certainly use them again""","Our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 June for our return flight, I have one big issue and some niggles. For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early.

Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120).

8,Aer Lingus,2,"""over 12 hours of delay""","Our flight from Chicago to Dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to Zürich did not wait in Dublin. No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn’t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn’t have flights to Zürich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Zürich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn’t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link.

9,Aer Lingus,1,"""our luggage has not been located""","There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,5/1/2023,3,4,4,1,1,1,Boston,Naples,True,Italy,False,International,lot choic book flight happen celebr mileston wed anniversari book trip itali flight fine arriv airport napl passeng flight 300 peopl stand baggag carousel shut bag pick passeng except us bag miss head miss baggag window fill miss baggag claim form sunday morn make way hotel cloth back week long stay celebr anniversari sure luggag tire two flight 10 hour wake next morn put cloth arriv get breakfast never mind new outfit luggag purchas trip float around somewher call aer lingu multipl time told luggag deliveri log miss baggag websit learn luggag locat yet spite aer lingu agent lie tell us phone bag way wouldnt go purchas necessari item chang keep aer lingu lost baggag cost lower 3rd full day itali aer lingu still stand claim one bag deliveri truth matter cant specifi en rout saga probabl continu us long depart itali two day add insult injuri aer lingu tell us accept necessari purchas wait hopelessli luggag talk given run around read comput screen bag rout escal call supervisor read script screen advic everyon book flight aer lingu valu peac mind entrust compani valu custom make sincer effort correct error time honest manner let face lot peopl like us dont travel time spent thousand hard earn dollar europ go four day skivvi arriv toler custom book anoth airlin valu peac mind,-0.5859,0.12594697,Positive,Negative

Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my!

I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!').

It took hours for them to de-ice the plane which is the airlines responsibility. The ground crew never told any of the passengers what was happening or how long we could expect to be delayed. The zero communication was very frustrating. The short flight to London had no complementary beverages of any sort despite the long delay. On our return flight to the U.S., in the Gatwick airport there was a single gate agent checking in 80+ passengers. We stood in line for almost an hour. Why Aer Lingus? We almost missed our flight despite arriving to the airport two hours early.

However this delay was not made known to anyone on the flight and after the gate changing 3 times and 4 hours after the plane was supposed to take off did the counter staff arrive and make an announcement of the delay which would cause my partner and I to miss our connection on Aer Lingus as well to Portugal.

She then said our reservations were cancelled by Aer Lingus and we would have to make our own arrangements to get home. I asked for the duty Manager who told me the same thing and suggested I call customer service. I made her call customer service and she got us on a BA to LHR and AA to BOS the next day.

44,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""handled so poorly""","New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,6/1/2019,3,3,3,1,2,2,New York,Tel Aviv,True,Israel,False,International,new york tel aviv via moscow june 2019 worst experi 've airlin flight jfk svo continu delay aeroflot without explan even though board time never chang board hour late told get 80 minut sit plane without sort commun aeroflot staff happen eventu claim tri solv mechan issu plane continu sit plane later heard airport staff comment idea board passeng clearli solv issu begin make matter wors despit flight take new york mani american englishspeak passeng board announc made russian got told would need wait 3 hour notifi statu flight wait almost 2 hour cancel flight fact admit cancel flight instead claim delay flight full 24 hour mani passeng includ upset frustrat end complet botch flight aeroflot seem plan respons scenario herd us upstair claim luggag us wait obscen long line check two aeroflot staff member claim updat ticket 24hourdelay flight andor hotel voucher alreadi delay hour wait line least addit 12 hour worst part whole disast aeroflot claim rebook anyon 's flight flight technic cancel delay accord reason airlin releas ticket flight cancel one effect clearli passeng rebook flight aeroflot abl get around delay flight staff hand new ticket hotel voucher quit rude display sympathi custom treat poorli airlin alreadi understand deal mani angri custom still could least apolog behalf airlin sure enough even though program tel aviv requir presenc delay flight 's arriv aeroflot would rebook flight lucki enough travel agent trip abl demand aeroflot rebook flight anoth airlin lot frustrat part requir rush anoth airport whole night sleep entir experi handl poorli unprofession begin end never fli aeroflot,-0.9678,-0.083732057,Negative,Negative

This was the first flight to be delayed, the staff at the gate and flight attendants were beyond rude and unhelpful, and the plane ride itself was horrendous.

We ran across the airport only to miss our connecting flight and play the game of how are we getting home.

The Almaty - Bangkok sector was a night flight on a new Dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 2.30 am.

I was at the check-in point with plenty of time (7:00pm.) The flight attendant told me ""there is a 3-hour delay because a baby got sick on the plane and they had to land."" She told me not to worry my connecting flight layover was 3.5 hours so I would have made it and they would have made up some time during the flight. At the gate I was told they had to change my connecting flight to Bologna to a later flight at 8:30pm instead of 2:55pm (a serious problem for me), but they told me that they only did that as a precaution in case I cannot make it to the original flight (at 2:55pm) which is what I had booked. The attendant at the gate told me that once in Dusseldorf I would have been able to take the Flight 8686 at 2:55pm. We boarded at 12:45am with more than 3 hours delay. We finally took off and on board I asked what I should do once in Dusseldorf. They said as soon as outside the aircraft look for the information point with Air Berlin attendants and they would have told me where to go to get to the original flight 8686. The flight attendant sent me to Gate B56 and warned me to ""hurry"" because the flight was departing in less than an hour. I ran to Gate B56 only to find no one there. I went to another attendant who told me that Flight AB 8686 was at Gate 44 two floors down. I ran again with a heavy backpack and a carry-on. I had to stop to catch my breath and I felt dizzy. Two police officers saw me and asked me if I was OK. I had to explain what happened to them because they were concern about my health. I finally made it to Gate B44. The Flight 8686 also departed with about 15 minutes delay. On board,  I had to pay for coffee €2.50 for a regular coffee.  At that point I only wanted to get to my final destination. We landed in Bologna BLQ about 10 minutes late. There I had the final humiliation: my baggage was missing. I went to Baggage claim and was told that probably my suitcase was moved to a later flight which will land at night around 10:30pm. I filed a complaint form there and they told me they should call me if the baggage arrives and I would have to go back to the airport to pick it up. It is now 9:30pm and on the Air Berlin website there still no information about my baggage. This has been a horrible experience.

Normally, obstacles like this wouldn't impact me, but traveling with kids makes a big difference (try to explain to your child he won't be able to recline the seat or use TV on 9 hrs flight). Lastly, and most importantly, Air Berlin lost our luggage. There were about 30 + other passengers flying on the same flight who reported missing luggage. It is been a week and we did not hear back from the airline. We sent about 11 emails to different departments with copies of claim, lost baggage tags, etc. No response.

It was the worst airline experience I have had in about 20 years of frequent flying. Here are some key reasons: Customer Service is non-existent. No one ever answers their phone number and their online service always returns an error message. I tried for two weeks both online and on telephone with one simple request, to upgrade my seat on my return flight (in other words, pay them more money!). One night, with Expedia on the line with me, we waited on hold for 95 minutes and I finally fell asleep at 1am. Also, with one exception on return flight, every single Air Berlin person I dealt with was not only extremely poor at customer service, but even rude. One flight attendant was just mean to the person in front of me who asked if they could give them their trash. Another flight attendant was rude when I asked a simple question at the counter. Another in baggage claim area in Berlin was rude. Their seats in economy are smaller than any other airline seat I have experienced. I had an eight hour flight with the seat back in front of me literally 10 inches from my face. I am 5 feet 5 inches and my knees hit the seat in front of me the whole time. Be aware they will charge you $60-100 extra just to pick a seat - any seat, including economy - in advance of your flight. The WIFI does not work. I paid for WiFi going over and back and was never able to get on it. The flight attendants were no help whatsoever and were again rude when I inquired The worst part was that I experienced two delayed flights - one from Berlin to Salzburg and one from Berlin to Chicago. Both were handled terribly. When I arrived late in Chicago to make my connection to MSP, I literally ran to the gate and got there in time to get on the flight, but Air Berlin without my consent or knowledge had changed my flight to a flight 4 hours later instead and American Airlines would not let me get on my original flight. When I called Air Berlin to complain about this while sitting in ORD for 4 hours, I again waited on hold for 2 hours and finally decided they did not deserve any more of my time or effort in giving them feedback.

There were people in the priority /business line waiting because the two staff that attended the site, were gone for a break , and no other attendance paid attention to us. Suddenly another travelers that arrived after us were allowed to go through, and when I complained, a very young man responded that they were attending first the Berlin passengers (was no way this gentleman could know, without asking, whether I was going also to Berlin?) When we arrived at the time of boarding (we were told at the counter that there was going to be a 25 minutes delay), we had to wait for an hour without anybody explaining what was going on. We later found out that they had to switch the aircraft, and make the catering. When we finally boarded, never were we were approached by our names, I had to wear my jacket, since nobody came to ask for it. Food (bad catering), but that was not all.

I did a few flights with them with a few minor problems (delayed flights, delayed luggage); I kept using them as I had already a bunch of miles and a gold status, but the last one was very bad and is the last drop. Connecting in Berlin will require you to change terminals by walking outside and going over security again. Their lounges are so bad that are almost always worse than the comparable regular waiting areas from better airlines. A lot of their web site is not working, specially if you are accesing it from outside of Germany. Their phone app is buggy and of very limited functionality. It is very hard to get hold of them on the phone, you have to navigate a maze of menus to get there and then wait for long periods of time. Their phone service is very fragmented, once I get to talk with someone it often happens that he or she can not do what I need and I need to call again. My average has been four calls to get anything done; this is in total with waiting and menu navigation about 45 minutes. Their phone service is not 24 hours, if you are in a different time zone than Germany you may have to actually wake up in the middle of the night to call. It is practically impossible to make use of miles for flight upgrades in their own flights. It is effectively impossible to use their miles to upgrade or buy any service from other airlines on the network. Booking an award fligh on their own flights requires you to call them, again, this is difficult; you cannot do it online. My last return flight was cancelled and I arrived with a 12 hour delay back home, losing a whole work day; they didn't offer lounge access during my 12 hour wait at the San Francisco airport.

When I arrived to the LAX airport, the Air Berlin manager on duty refused to let me carry my guitar on board, she also refused to receive a printed copy of the US Federal law and she even refused my right as a passenger to speak to the senior flight attendant hoping to find a solution.

105,Air Canada,1,"""support lines are totally overwhelmed""","I purchased a ticket to fly Washington-Nairobi return in business class via Toronto, Frankfurt and Zurich late June/early July 2023. All flights but the first were code shares on other reputable carriers, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. I've had excellent experiences with Air Canada in the past and really looked forward to this family trip. Just before departure, Air Canada cancelled its flight from Washington because of staff shortages. I called Air Canada and, secured a satisfactory booking via Montreal. That was almost immediately cancelled, leaving me trying to call Air Canada support till around 4am. After multiple calls and hours on hold, I was booked on a United flight to Toronto connecting with Lufthansa on to Nairobi. When I arrived at Washington Dulles, United reported that AC had only made a booking, but had not reissued my ticket as required AC staff at the airport said they were only ramp agents, they couldn't sort out the problem. I had to call Air Canada customer support. Eventually, they called AC support, waited 45 minutes on hold, and then had the needed ticket issued. I thought, foolishly, that my problems were over. Alas, AC had only reissued an outbound ticket from Toronto to Nairobi, without replacing the original round trip ticket. When I arrived in Nairobi, my return flight had disappeared from the Lufthansa system on the grounds that I was a no-show for the outbound flight, leaving me stranded in Nairobi. After an entire night and half a day trying to reach Air Canada support, AC staff finally agreed to restore my return ticket. Reaching AC took about an hour and a half on hold on each occasion, and AC dropped most of these calls after a few minutes. Only on arrival at Nairobi airport did I realize that AC had bungled my return ticket, having me depart Frankfurt for Zurich before I arrived in Zurich. Fortunately, the Lufthansa staff in Nairobi were able to sort this out on departure. I understand hat it's tough running an airline right now, resurgent demand, staff and plane shortages, forest fires etc. But the AC system demands that clients call their agents way more than should be necessary. And, at the moment, ACs customer support lines are totally overwhelmed.

114,Air Canada,1,"""Worst flight experience""","Worst flight experience. Travelled with two small children and two car seats. When flight was booked it stated one carryon and one personal item per passenger. We took 2 carry on bags and strapped the car seats to each for more convenient transport since we had two small children in tow. When we went to get boarding passes, they told us we had to check our carryons. I told them it was our mode of transport for the car seats and they said it was policy on small full flights that all carryons be checked unless flying business class. I said can we just check at the gate if there is truly no space. Again told no. I said it would have been nice to have been told this information sooner than the day of the flight o we could have arranged for a different mode of transport for the car seats or packages them properly to check them. The first gate wasn’t too far but to get to the connecting flight it was far. We had to carry these bulky awkward car seats with no good surfaces to hold the entire trip.

115,Air Canada,2,"""the worst airline I've flown""","Awful. We had two legs - first in a Dash-8 from SEA to YVR, then a 777-300 to LHR. Our first flight was delayed by an hour for a number of reasons. When we landed the connecting flight was already in the boarding process and we had to high tail it straight through the airport. Good job we were travelling light with carryon only - at Heathrow we passed a crowd of unfortunate travellers who had checked bags on the first leg and none of them had made it on the second flight. This included a couple whose carryon had been checked because there wasn't enough room overhead. The main leg of the journey was 9.5 hours. The legroom in economy was abysmal - I'm 5'11 and I had to put my knees in the little hard nooks either side of the seat under the next row's armrests. I was fortunate that passengers sitting each side of me were quite petite and were able to twist sideways a little for us all to fit. The entertainment system was good, although don't expect headphones to be provided by Air Canada. You can request earbuds that hurt after an hour or so of use, so make sure you bring your own nice headphones. The food was awful. I had ordered an Asian Vegetarian special meal - usually a safe bet for a bit of flavour on an airplane. It came warm on the outside and still frozen in the center. No bread or butter - it consisted of a small portion of plain cous cous, a some rice with a single cauliflower floret, and a tiny pot of tinned fruit salad. The regular meal seemed to be equally unappetising - chicken in tomato sauce. I noticed that my neighbours on the flight both left most of theirs. But at least they got a roll and a slice of cheese with their meal. I also had no drink with my meal, as they served all the special meals first before prepping the others, and they brink the drinks cart round after the regular meal cart.  The stewardess who seemed to be most in charge of things had an awful attitude with both passengers and her colleagues. Didn't see a single smile out of them the whole flight. You get a comically small bottle of water on the plane, but getting hold of anyone for another is an absolute mission. I managed to catch a stewardess as they were walking up the aisle to ask for some water, they just said that a bar service would be coming through shortly. It did, albeit an hour later, and that was the only time cold drinks were served on the flight. I also saw some poor victim get the same treatment from the other side of the aircraft - came to the galley to ask for a soda, told to return to his seat and they'd be coming through soon, which they didn't.

116,Air Canada,1,"""consistently and extremely awful""","I travelled round trip from Seattle to Punta Cana via Toronto. On the way there, there were several issues. First off, seats were highly uncomfortable. Furthermore, the cushions were poorly secured, and slid around underneath you. The leg room was nonexistent. I literally could not fit my knees in front of me on the plane.  There were no power outlets or Wi-Fi on the plane. The return flight was what really set this experience apart though. Terrible seats, no leg room, no amenities. However, the airline made a mistake scheduling the flight, causing it to be 3 hours delayed. Our layover was 3 hours and 40 minutes, which meant that we would have 20 minutes to get to our gate. We contacted the airline about this, and they assured us that we would easily be able to make our connection (quote “that is plenty of time to get there”), and that they would hold the plane back a few minutes to wait for us if necessary. Upon arriving after an uncomfortable and long flight, we could not make it to the other gate in time, and they refused to hold it back for us. The airline scheduled us flights to Seattle the next day, with a layover. We were supposed to get to Seattle Sunday afternoon, but our new flight plan had us arriving late Monday evening. We then waited over 2 hours in line at a very busy and crowded Air Canada service desk. the service was incredibly slow, but eventually they told us that there were much better flights we could have got that would have gotten us home much earlier, but they sold out in the time we stood in the line.

Unfortunately things went downhill from there on. Boarding was absolute mayhem with gate agents giving conflicting instructions. To make matters worse, instead of using the zone-based queues at the designated gate, they decided to use the lanes of the neighbouring gate causing a mass migration, not to mention confusion, for some 200 passengers. The gate agents were not only unorganized they were actually surly with the passengers. In the end it became a free-for-all boarding experience. When I got on board, I mentioned the chaos at the gate to one of the agents who was not even remotely interested in hearing about it and pretty much brushed it off. We were almost 40 minutes late leaving FLL which stretched the flight duration from 3 hours to 4 gate to gate. During this time the FA’s came around with water and beverage service only once and acted as if they were doing the passengers a favour.

The original flight was scheduled for July 8, 2021 and I had obtained a COVID test on July 6th which was negative. The fight from West Palm Beach to Washington was delayed about one hour and a half due to bad weather and therefore the connection to Toronto was missed by a few minutes. The notation on the display boards indicated that it was still boarding but it had departed by the time I got to the gate. I feel that the airlines must know that there are people wanting to connect on any fight and know which flights are delayed and which flights are arriving, therefore could have waited about 15 minutes to half an hour longer. A United Airlines customer service representative confirmed me on the earliest flight possible to Toronto which was the next day at 4:30 p.m. Was that the first possible flight with any airline or any connection? SO I had to stay at a hotel in the Dulles area from July 8th to July 9th. When I got to the Air Canada check in the next day I was still within the 72 hour limit for the COVID test and the attendant told me that they went by the flight departure time - which I had no control over - which was 4:30 p.m. a time difference of only a few hours. SO I had to take a RAPID COVID TEST which cost $250 U.S. at the Dulles airport right then. Since the world has been battling this pandemic for over a year now, there has been a practice of quarantining for 14 days as the virus take 14 days to be established. Therefore why would another test on July 9th, show anything but a negative result? I now have paid close to $500 U.S. for the two tests with a last vaccination date of April 1, 2021. I do not want to pay this extra $250 simply because the person at the check-in was young and overly officious, and making a capricious and arbitrary decision.

Service: only a bottle of water laid on the seat with no pre-flight drink service like other ""business class"" offerings from other airlines. The wine, if one wants to call it that, was barely drinkable and I chose the pasta meal choice because the curry from the butter chicken was making me nauseous and I was in row 1! The crew did the mandatory service of drinks followed by lunch then a snack before landing. However, in between all of this there was hardly any follow-up with the premium class passengers. They were more concerned with ensuring that the curtain from the cabin to the galley was shut solid with the velcro closures.

146,Air China,8,"""Service was smooth""","I had serious concerns about this airline before taking my trip, but ended up having a very good experience. So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well.

147,Air China,1,"""missed the connecting flight""","Los Angeles to Shanghai via Beijing. The flight arrived late into Beijing and I missed the connecting flight to Los Angeles. They made everyone wait in an area for forty minutes, then put everyone in a bus that got lost twice and took ninety minutes to get to a hotel. No food was provided, my bathroom had no shower door and had a clogged sink. I was the only Caucasian amongst all Chinese. Not a word of English was spoken. When flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai five days earlier the same thing occurred. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to spend the night in Beijing. Rather than accept their accommodation I took the money they offered, forty six dollars and found a four star hotel that cost $250. Air Canada had its passengers stay at the same, pricey but reasonable, hotel. The following day, after spending three hours on the tarmac, without any communication from the pilots, the flight finally departed for Shanghai. Returning from Shanghai I was wiser but no less lucky. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing showed that it would be delayed and I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Los Angeles. An hour prior to the flight leaving I informed the airline staff that I would miss my connecting flight and requested they instead arrange another one. I even showed them flight options on my phone. The answer was no answer. I had to take the flight or be left on my own in Shanghai, not knowing what would happen. I took the flight to Beijing and was then taken to the hotel. I kept asking myself, why can’t Air China run some very simple regression analysis to determine the chances of customers making flights given variables like seasonal weather patterns and historic flight delays. The only answer I could come up with was they either do not think it is important or do not know how to do it. Why do airports in China suffer some of the longest delays in the world? As mentioned in the Economist, “The first reason is that its airports err on the side of extreme safety.” This is consistent with state run ideology. Play it safe. No mistakes, and you won’t get in trouble.

153,Air China,1,"""They just don't care""","New York to Bangkok via Beijing. I've been traveling for years and this is the 1st and last time I will ever use them. I just got married and my husband and I planned a 2 month honeymoon to Asia. We purchased a round trip from JFK with a layover in Beijing before arriving in Bangkok. The return flight was from Hong Kong with layover in Beijing before landing in Newark, NJ. Our flight in April to Bangkok experienced multiple delays which caused us to miss our layover in Beijing by 5 minutes. We actually had a 75 mins layover in Beijing, but due to the delays, we and almost everyone else on our plane missed our transfers. They couldn't tell their other planes to wait 5-10 mins for everyone to make their flights?? Instead, we saw most of the fliers crowded around the Air China counter. Everyone had to get a temporary visa and herd onto their buses to spend a night in a disgusting, filthy motel because the next flights out were the following day. My husband and I missed our 1st night in Bangkok and of course weren't reimbursed in any way. Throughout the ordeal, we saw all of the passengers at the Air China counters and they, like us, were appalled and furious with their lack of customer service. They just don't care. Now for our flight returning back to NY from Hong Kong on 6/17. We received an email saying that Air China changed our flights so we called Chase Travel. We saw that they changed the planes, times and moved us from Premium Economy to Economy. Why? We paid the extra amount for Economy. Once on the phone with Chase, we selected another flight for 7:30AM that was Premium Economy. We even waited on the phone until we received the email confirmation from Chase for our new flights. So on 6/17 we get to HK airport to check in and they only have my husband's name and not mine. Air China said I was on a 11PM flight and that it was Chase's fault. That was not the case.

Instead of just putting me on the 7:30AM flight, they kept my husband on hold for 50 minutes, then finally told him that they could change his flight for $4000 to be with me for the 11PM. How does that make sense? Why are we being punished for Air China's mistake? They changed our flights then split us up but putting us on different flights that land in different airports. Then they have the audacity to tell him to pay $4000 for him to be on the 11PM when they could've just put me on the 7:30AM which was confirmed. They could have even put us on the next Air China flight after that. My husband ended up purchasing completely new flights with EVA which was $2800 compared to the $2500 round trip with Air China!

Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it.

173,Air France,1,"""cabin crew were absolutely excellent""","Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

174,Air France,1,"""goodbye Air France!""","I was taking a full-priced Delta ATL-JFK-LIS flight on January 10, 2023. Unfortunately my ATL-JFK flight was delayed, which would cause me to miss the connecting flight to LIS. Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me. The nightmare continued in CDG when I was told I was not in Air France systems, so I cannot fly to LIS. However, the lady at CDG counter immediately escalated and resolved the situation. What a sharp contrast between the two employees from the same company! The Air France counter person in Atlanta (I still do not know her name) was rude and was all ""snappy"" and ""powerful"" when dealing with customers. The moment she said ""I am deboarding you now!"" I knew I was not talking to a normal person. While waiting to be boarded, a few other Delta passengers complained that she also charged them luggage fees - ignoring Delta policies.

So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result.

It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available.

184,Air France,6,"""The in flight experience was fine""","We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back.

202,Air New Zealand,1,"""They do not care about their customers""","Due to the pandemic, I have been unable to fly with this airline as of yet. My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020, which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years, we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand, or in the case of this year, members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again, the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse, the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a $175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my family's money back. After years of dealing with this airline, they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute, and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline, do not accept their Disney dollars, and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers, and after I take this flight some time in the next few years, whenever my family is financially able to, I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried, I would happily fly with them again, but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated.

The company recently had a workers strike that caused them to cancel multiple flights. The issue here isn’t the strike, it is how ATN handled it. Their response to the situation was terrible, with not only a lack of communication to affected passengers, but purposeful misinformation when you spoke to their representatives. My wife and I talked about taking this trip 10 years ago when we got married. We saved our money, spent the last 7 months planning, and then flew to LAX the day before our flight to PPT via ATN. Less than 23 hours before take-off, they cancelled the flight. They provided nothing more than general statements saying they were in the process of rebooking. Then nothing but silence. My wife called their representatives later in the day and were told that we would have a flight out THAT DAY and would be contacting us. Then more silence, nothing. Again called in and were offered a flight 4 days from now, cutting our trip on half. Absolutely unacceptable. We ended up not getting rebooked, not receiving any direct communication from ATN, and had to cancel our trip. If they had been more prepared for this contingency, as most competent enterprises are, they would have had plans in place in why to do when this happens. Instead, we lost our chance to go to Bora Bora.

216,Air Tahiti Nui,1,"""Business Class product was terrible""","Their lack of care, lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti (regional carrier) to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight, Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling, we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so it's not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear, we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX, the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers (as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late). There was a line of about 200+ passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office! After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day, why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation, fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room. Inflight entertainment was very limited and food was ""just OK' but nothing I would expect from a flag carrier. Internet never worked and while flight attendant service was very cordial, it certainly does not make up for their lack of customer service.

The nightmare started on our flight from LAX to PPT. Discovered Air Tahiti Nui does not have a designated ticket counter so you can only check in 2 hours before flight departs. This caused an issue because in order to gain access to any club lounge you need a boarding pass. Our flight arrived in LAX about 5 hours before the LAX to PPT departed so had to sit and wait in LAX for 3 hours until Air Tahiti Nui ticket counter opened. By that time there was a long line of people and the staff at Air Tahiti Nui did not seem to care how fast they processed people. So we were not able to go to our lounge and eat and relax so we had to pay for our lunch and stand around because of very limited seating in the lobby of LAX. After checking our bags we went to the gate displayed on my ticket and on the overhead boards and on my flight app. Several people started going up the the gate ticket counter asking why boarding had not started with only 10 minutes before our flight was suppose to depart. No answers. Staff simply did not seem to care. Five minutes before boarding an announcement was made of a gate change to 153 which was about 1/2 mile away all the way down to the other end of the concourse. We ran to the the other end only to wait 1.5 hours to board with more delays and no explanation. During this time I talked to a couple the long time LAX employees. They stated this happens all the time with Air Tahiti Nui. During our flight we purchase exit row seats. The Air Tahiti Nui staff allowed long lines to queue up and use our exist row areas as acceptable areas for people to stand and stretch, causing people to step on our feet several times. We brought this to the attention of the staff but they did not seem to care. Service was touted a very friendly and a great Tahitian experience. Do not believe what they tell you and show in their slick ads. We had a similar experience on way back. Sorry but once from LAX to PPT and PPT to LAX was enough.

The other plane we flew in their fleet had a larger tablet screen and usb port for charging. The crew did what they needed to do but nothing more, unless you buzzed them or fly business class.

I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said ""Yes"" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat.

Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired?

They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone.

I was informed when I was making my complaint that unaccompanied minor status was only paid for and applied at time of check in. Why didn’t the phone representative inform my husband when he placed the reservation? I also learned Alaska Airlines is focused on money more than a minor’s safety. I explained that I had been allowed to accompany my child to the gate for the departing flight and the supervisor I was speaking to exclaimed, “And she didn’t charge you!” I would not have expected to be charged just as I did not expect to fill out a form during check-in because we believed we had paid it as part of the rather expensive ticket we already paid. The supervisor criticized me for not searching out this information on the website. We believed everything was taken care of because we had Spoken to Alaska airline representatives, both when we made the reservation and during check-in. Apparently representative’s words cannot be trusted. Because of the lack of competency on the part of Alaska airlines, our minor child was not met by the guardian at the gate upon arrival. The guardian was not allowed to accompany our minor child through security on the return flight, and was not present as guardian and witness when our minor child was searched all around their privates by TSA.

However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all, which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind there’s no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I don’t plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience.

Cons 1) The twin-engine plane (Boeing 737, I believe) economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia.

288,Alaska Airlines,1,"""so uncomfortable and sad""","Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesn’t fly there). I’ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, I’m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I don’t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew can’t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. I’ve never been offended. I’ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to ”tell on me”. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. It’s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who don’t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the “rude” passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.",Business,Business Class,1/1/2023,4,1,4,4,4,4,Portland,Nome,True,United States,True,Domestic,let start rant say fli lot usual delta occasion aa quicker rout transfer alaska airlin last leg trip nome delta doesnt fli ive never complaint flight crew ever instead im person watch flight crew complet awe long shift work kind show us alway grate like everyon els often bewild gener rude public toward staff experi today 1523 alaska airlin flight quicker rout sent portland anchorag chose amount mile fli typic get upgrad first class even dont purchas today first class seat purchas end sit busi class exactli one row behind first class complet fine complaint reason rant horribl experi today alaska airlin flight 197 delay approx 1 15 hour flight origin late night flight anyway made thing bit wors complet understand thing happen flight crew cant control plane arrivaldepartur howev 3 hour delay flight everyon sound asleep absolut movement throughout plane complet graveyard silenc got use restroom walk closest one liter 5 row front first class beauti blond flight attend walk told turn around go restroom back one aisl line either restroom everyon asleep absolut floor realli embarrass gentleman sit next overheard roll eye turn around see peopl busi class use first class restroom time ive never offend ive never seen anyon rerout back anyway went back restroom ask two flight attend work back polici rule unawar minut later two attend back rush front tell absolut reason proceed make announc intercom everyon instruct non first class peopl use back restroom mind one except move around concern commonli bulli peopl first class make point tri embarrass custom announc petti team bulli first time understand peopl speak confront flight attend treat poorli get posit submiss travel uncomfort sad suppos lesson alway fli delta importantli mind peopl dont mean fli first class treat may rude passeng thought flight staff,-0.7927,0.034505208,Neutral,Negative

297,Alaska Airlines,1,"""the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way""","Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, ""well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew"". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she ""must be strapped into her own seat"". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says ""nope, strap her in"". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says ""somebody's first flight eh"". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them.

300,Alaska Airlines,1,"""rude customer service representative""","We had a layover in Seattle on November 29th. Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaska’s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered “their fault”, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldn’t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesn’t have this figured out. Even on the Alaska’s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that “if we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensation”. To which I replied “you should”. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said “what weather?” Again in hadn’t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasn’t snowing. She yelled at me and stated “Give me back your tickets”. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated “no” you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldn’t even be here, that she should be home. I couldn’t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that “You will be losing a customer, not that you care”. And she said extremely snarky “No, I don’t think we will”. I said “Excuse me, you don’t think you will what?” She reiterated, “I don’t think we will be losing a customer”. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home. I asked for her name and she would not provide me her last name.

In Boston - I requested assistance, they refused to help me to the counter. My luggage was falling, I was tripping. But I got no help! Then I was told I had to put my checked luggage on the platform. I said I needed help I was told ""you have to put your luggage up here"". So a disabled woman tripping and falling over a cane managed to put up a 50 pound piece of luggage. Only after did the incompetent woman ask if I needed assistance? I had asked for help three times and was told no! So I said - if I'm required and able to lift a 50 pound suitcase by myself, I will get myself down to the gate since Alaska Airlines is useless.

My wife and friend had no tickets and we were to fly out the next day. I went back to Google and found a different number to a nice lady in Boise. She informed me that we had been scammed. I asked to have it reversed and she stated, ""there is nothing I can do. We have this a lot. Scammers cancel the tickets and try to get the refund."" I asked why there isn't a verification text or email to confirm the cancelation? Especially if this is something that happens often. She then said we could purchase tickets at a 400% mark up. Having no options, we did just that. Once we got the new tickets we realized they were for our exact original seats.

They say it will be another 20-40 minutes until we can get off the plane (I’m annoyed at this point but recognize it’s almost over I’ll be home soon) 8) This process repeats multiple times. We are told every 20-40 minutes that it will be another “20-40 minutes” and this goes on for approximately 2 hours. During this time, as a consultation they offer us an 8oz middle school milk carton of water? 9) Finally we get a gate, we pull up, everyone starts standing up getting their bags out of overhead and we all start to notice it’s taking a while to open the door (about 15 minutes at this point) and then the announcement comes on that there is “an issue of a large gap between the plane and the hallway thing that connects to the plane” and at this point the plane is turned off, meaning the AC is turned off and we’re forced to sit there for another 25 minutes before finally getting off the plane.

329,Alaska Airlines,3,"""a frustrating experience""","I had a frustrating experience with Alaska. I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our ""wagon"" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to ""solve"" the problem threatened us by saying ""do you want to fly today?"". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain.

My partner's 10 year old son and his friend / guardian were supposed to fly out of PDX, after visiting us for two weeks, on July 13th for a 10 am flight. After they boarded, everyone on the flight got the run around as to why they were delayed and then had to get off the flight and got rebooked for the following day, July 14th for 3pm. For some reason they were told to get off the plane but their luggage somehow made it to Seattle, which was an absolute nightmare because my partners son doesn't live with us, nor his friend, so they didn't have anything as to clothes or toiletries for the next day, except whatever they were wearing. My partner's friend and son waited about 6 hours after the supposed initial take off at the airport due to the delays, with three of those hours getting the run around as to where their luggage is. My partner had to leave work to go pick them up. I get on the phone with Alaska that evening after work to try to find out where their bags are and to get compensation for the whole deal. We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us. They gave us a $50 voucher for each to get underwear, socks, and stuff for the night and told us to call customer care in the morning. I called customer care in the morning and the lady was just God awful, no help what so ever. I asked for a refund on the $60 luggage fee since they didn't get have their luggage and thought that was a fair compensation. We were told Alaska doesn't do refunds and put me back on the phone with baggage. Baggage reassured us that the bags would be in Albuquerque when they landed. Well they landed in Albuquerque to find out that their luggage was sent back to Portland and they will fly it back to deliver it later to their address sometime this week or next week. Seriously? First Alaska delayed their flight until the next day, gave us the run around and we lost work hours, can't give us a straight story on the luggage claim, and when we ask just for the a refund on the $60 luggage fee they so no, we don't do refunds but here's a $50 voucher for a future flight. How about no, we are never flying Alaska Airlines again. I flew Southwest last year and my flight was delayed 4 hours, they gave me a $100 voucher without even asking. Seriously Alaska?

361,Allegiant Air,1,"""So disappointing and astounding""","I write reviews a lot online, and 95% of the time, I only write reviews for positive interactions. I feel that negative reviews are generally screwed by emotion, frustration, or anger. And that we have enough negativity in our world. So I try to keep things positive. In this case, I think it’s necessary to document the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced - which came from Allegiant phone customer service. I have never been treated so poorly by an employee of a company that I’ve spent hundreds of dollars patronizing (or any company, for that matter). There was a mix-up when my family flew in for a visit. Their return flight was canceled after they missed an outbound flight, and when we realized this (the night before their return flight), I called to understand the situation. Originally, the gate agent told them their return flight would not be canceled but that they could keep it. So we were surprised when we couldn’t find the reservation for them to check-in. The person who I talked to on the phone to try to fix the problem was unbelievably rude. After discussing the situation, she didn’t believe my family because the agent didn’t make notes, and her attitude toward me was unlike any experience I’ve ever had with a customer service person. I intentionally did my best to stay calm, not raise my voice or have a frustrated or angry tone and asked to speak with her supervisor after she yelled at me. After continuing to be berated by the employee, I calmly continued to ask to talk with her supervisor. She denied me the opportunity several times (she said the supervisor couldn’t help) and eventually *hung up the phone on me!* I understand and can appreciate how hard customer service jobs must be. So again, I did everything possible not to talk down to this person or raise my voice. And I was hung up on. I don’t understand how this airline could possibly prioritize basic respect for one another if this was how their employee acted. I assume they are not teaching patience or customer care (human care) in any fashion. Honestly, nobody should be treated with the disrespect this person showed. The way I was treated was not worth saving a little money to fly cheaply.

She kept cutting me off and reciting what sounded like a script that she was reading off of her computer screen. By the time she was finished listing all of the applicable fees, she said my $200 ticket was really only worth $23. I asked to speak to a supervisor and again attempted to explain the extenuating circumstances under which I needed to make a change, but she continued to rudely cut me off mid-sentence.

My flight departed from the rather small-sized Terminal 4, and with the amount of layover I had plus the quick service in Los Angeles, I had plenty of time to kill in the Admirals Club lounge which was very cozy and comfortable. The staff in Los Angeles were just okay. Boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined, and I was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews. Take-off was only 10 minutes late, but eventually, we landed half an hour ahead of schedule. Their A321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip LED lighting, but sadly no personal TVs. The seat was cozy and comfortable, easy to use, and adequately spacious for a 2.5-hour flight like this. Throughout the flight, the flight attendants were friendly, courteous, and attentive, although they could've been better if they were not just meddling with their phones and re-ensure that everyone is doing okay. once the service is complete. The Biscoff biscuit was exquisite and tasty. The real positive thing about this flight was the Wi-Fi. It allowed me to browse anything, open social media apps, and watch videos on the ground for around 20 minutes. Once I took off, the social media apps and browsing feature no longer existed, but live TV shows, videos, movies, and games were provided through the American Airlines portal. The signal strength was quite poor, but the contents and the layout of the portal were incredibly good. Despite landing 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the baggage delivery at Dallas Fort Worth was ridiculously slow, causing me to wait around 45-60 minutes.

I stood there as the 2 employees spoke to each other saying how the people standing in line are ""stupid because they are wasting their time because customer service wont help them"" and laughed about how they would be going home soon after their shifts.

My most recent flight with American Airlines was delayed by 17 hours and customer relations refuses to give me a refund. I was/am pregnant and was traveling with my 18 month old son. Our layover between flights was supposed to be only 1 hour and turned into a stressful, exhausting 17 hour delay. We waited until 1 am at our gate when we were told to change terminals entirely to go to different gate. After waiting an hour more at this new gate, American Airlines canceled the flight entirely for that night. We were given an $11 meal voucher and told to “book our own hotels” and American would reimburse us. Finally at 4 in the morning I was able to get my 18 month old son to sleep at a hotel we had to book and get an Uber to with no help from American. We only were able to stay for 4 hours before heading back to the airport. When we got back our flight was delayed again. We boarded a plane, we’re told to get off and change planes and wait. It was so tiring and during this time no more meal vouchers were offered so I was paying for everything out of pocket. I missed two days of work because of this fiasco. Since this trip from hell, I have been contacting American Airlines and offered no refunds or compensation. The only thing I was given was a $25 credit for my next flight. No I am not kidding. $25! Not even a refund for the hotel they promised to pay for! I quite literally lost over a thousand dollars because of this flight and I do not have that kind of money.

455,American Airlines,1,"""at least have the decency to be honest""","American Airlines itself is a decent airline, but the fact that approx. 5 - 7% of their flights are direct flights is a capital crime. Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think ""OK, not bad at all"" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed. After finding out that upgrading my seat from aisle to window, would be $54, US as well. That's fun! American Airlines screws up and still wants to charge for trying to rectify the situation. Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me ""You can certainly book a flight with United"" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don't expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it's a part of travel. The whole ""it's about the journey, not the destination"" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured. American, please get your stuff together. Remember, you are not the only airline in the skies.

When I got to the airport I went to scan my e-ticket which clearly showed I have a first class seat. The machine said I was too late to check luggage. It didn’t make sense. I was 2 hours early. A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasn’t on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email, my e-ticket that showed my seat number and he said it didn’t matter. I don’t exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didn’t tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he would’ve seen that I was first class. I didn’t want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after, but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down, but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasn’t thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business.

So, during one of the busiest travel times of the year, at one of AA’s principal hubs, they didn’t have the wherewithal — parts and/or expertise — to make this repair. In other words, this terrible experience was 100% due to AA’s incompetence. Meanwhile, we got closer and closer in time to predicted, severe thunderstorms, raising the suspicion that AA was hoping nature would let them off the hook for canceling the flight.

499,American Airlines,1,"""horrific disaster""","Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmare of trying to get our flights rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should ever have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimately ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline's part. The customer service we experienced from American throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system's incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements, being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably to treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency. Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened.

The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them.

I've done this twice in the past year and both trips (a total of 4 flights) provided similar experiences. I have had consistently poor service (or lack thereof). The planes honestly scare me with how many obvious repairs (that don't seem particularly well done) have been done to these ancient airplanes. They seem dirty as well, though that could just be the yellowed plastic from age. The seats are hit or miss depending on how worn out the cushion is. They don't seem to have been replaced since the airplanes were manufactured (probably 20-30 years ago by the looks of them). The planes are small so if you have a standard to large carry on, it will have to be checked in. This is more FYI, since they can't really control the size of the overhead compartments (though they could buy planes made in this decade and solve this issue). The counter was supposed to have staff from 4 am - 7 pm, according to a sign on their counter. There was no one there at all. Keep in mind this small airport has 2 gates and an average of 3 flights a day. I would presume having an employee man the counters for three flights wouldn't be too much to ask, but apparently it is for American Eagle. I can't really comment on their in-flight service since, in all fairness, their flights are usually too short to be able to provide any services. However, I can comment that the pilots do not fly well, and I legitimately thought the plane had crash landed at first when the plane just dropped several meters out of the sky on landing.

I was very surprised by the fact that they allowed overbooking, and they had to find 4 volunteers to move to the next flight. The crew member mentioned that the current flight will not be going anywhere until they find volunteers to move to the next flight. Is this a joke? It's a simple math that if the flight is full, they should not take any more customers, but it happened. Not only this delayed the departure time, they provided no compensation whatsoever for people who waited to meet their schedule; this is outrageous.

573,American Eagle,1,"""a vast contrast""","Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",Business,Premium Economy,5/1/2016,3,4,5,1,1,1,CMH,LGA,True,United States,True,Domestic,flew american eagl columbu new york vast contrast fli american airlin mainlin american eagl american eagl ae avoid option especi rout use one old embraer bombardi plane insist gate check roll bag crj700 erj140 erj145 american airlin mainlin airlin choic especi fli intern fli ae columbu frequent connect aa mainlin intern flight use book delta connect dc flight separ ticket avoid ae dc schedul chang make option impract exampl ae 5050 chanc arriv columbu wait coupl hundr yard back gate 10 minut wing ground handler saunter break room marshal aircraft onto stand wait averag 1520 minut gate check bag deliv back jet bridg dc normal 3 minut aircraft type hold check bag better allow full 45 minut deliv carousel weather disrupt anywher aa network delay cancel ae flight especi flight 2nd tier base benefit mainlin hub flight get shrug shoulder staff statement weather relat airlin bear respons delay etc 20 chanc mainten issu given flight older fleet normal take 20 minut fix issu typic hour updat mainten logbook journey continu unfortun ae wing oper bad wing staff appear hustl nice passeng,-0.4404,0.037651515,Neutral,Neutral

I changed my flight from Business Class to First Class from BKK to ORD. There was no First Class on NH808 from BKK to NRT. So, I flew Business Class and there was no food until about 1.30 before landing in NRT. Once again the flight attendants were outstanding. After arriving in NRT, I was escorted to the ANA First Class Suite lounge for the 8 next hours. Not very many people in the lounge. I was escorted to NH012 and boarded. Only 3 of us in First Class. The most outstanding flight service began. All the Flight Attendants introduced themselves. After the take-off and the meal service started. It really looked as if was going to a feast.

Be aware that C, D and H seats on the 777 have an entertainment box limiting your leg space but in because the width of the seat is wider, so it wasn't too bad but just annoying. The flight was punctual and everything ran smoothly. IFE was available and featured movies in English but had an extensive Japanese menu. There were no English TV shows, only Japanese TV serials. My food was awful. The main course was very small and very salty and not well presented.It was an odd mix of cold soba noodles, a sushi roll with edamame, a bun with butter and a salad, usually Japanese style potato salad with mayonnaise. They handed out a half sandwich halfway through the flight (egg salad) and drinks were offered regularly. The wine selection was dreadful and my sparkling wine undrinkable.  We were offered eye masks, toothbrushes and earplugs. Everyone had a pair of slippers and earphones in their seat. There was a blanket and pillow but the plane was too hot for use of the blanket. The staff responded promptly to calls and all requests and I was impressed with them. They are way better than SQ and gives SQ a run for its money. After a 2 hour wait in Narita, boarded the 787 for KUL. Again, a smooth journey, food offerings again small, salty and a confusing mix of Japanese and Western on a tray. Note that food offerings in PE is same as economy and their website says they provide PE passengers with a business class dessert but that never appeared.

I paid US$825, all-in including taxes, for a round trip journey of 3 legs in each way. HKG-NRT-IAH-LIM & back (United Airlines codeshare IAH-LIM). Incredible pricing. Even from the ground, the check-in process (Haneda) was seamless and it took us a mere 10 minutes for check-in and security and immigration combined. Despite the aircraft (B767 & B777) being of some age, their interiors were retrofitted with up-to-date IFE (with a huge selection of the latest movies, no lagging or dead screens), and USB & laptop charging ports. The widebody aircraft meant that overhead storage space was more than sufficient and nobody had any problems finding space for their bags. The legroom in economy was one of the best we had ever experienced in economy. Recline could be better. (I'm 5""11 or 1.81m and I could stretch my legs out fully), seats were fairly comfortable and I had no problems sleeping 6-7 hours at a go on the 13hr flight and this is in economy. FA service was extremely hospitable. They served 2 meals and a snack over the course of 13 hours. The meals were great and as good as what some average Japanese restaurants would serve. It is also worth noting that the checked baggage arrived with no incident. The only minor gripe, perhaps, is that the 3-4-3 configuration in economy is quite a squeeze.

The B777 aircraft is an older version enroute to Seoul. The food is ok, not great as I was expecting. In my opinion they should just serve the Bibimbap enroute to Seoul and something different should be served in between Seoul and Manila and Seoul to LAX. That kind of explains why they have toothbrushes and mouthwash in the lavatories. While on transit in Seoul, the seats in the boarding gates are so stiff. I looked around for better seats to rest and I couldn't find any. The room is also small that there aren't enough seats for everybody. Some passengers just stood and wait for the next flight. Upon boarding, everybody rushed in again without any order. There still is no systematic boarding, unlike China Southern, EVA Airways, Cathay Pacific and Air China.

Flight out from LA was about an hour late departing. Ticketing/baggage check at LAX pretty hectic. Flew A380 upper deck economy on LA to Incheon, row 75. Upper deck Economy on Asiana is 2-4-2. Had window and aisle seat, large storage compartment next to window. Legroom was just average. Asiana does not offer a premium economy, but charges $100 extra for some bulkhead rows with extra legroom. Service was friendly and efficient. Korean food option was very good. Inflight entertainment was comprehensive with US, Korean and world movie/TV options. ICN to Beijing leg was scheduled to be an A330, but they substituted an A321 that was only half full. Two hour flight departed and arrived on-time. It was uneventful, and was served a breakfast with a choice of western or Chinese food. The return from Shanghai Pudong was on a packed new A350. Seating was 3-3-3 and the first 4 or 5 rows in economy had a couple of extra inches of legroom, for $150 extra. Since it was less than a 2 hour flight I chose not to pay extra. The A350 had seatback entertainment system with a full compliment of movies and TV from both US and Asian sources. We were served a warm lunch, again with western or Asian food choices. We stayed over for 2 nights in Seoul before returning to LA on Asiana flight 204. Check-in at Incheon went very smoothly, using a self check terminal to generate a boarding pass and then dropping our bags. At bag check, the Asiana clerk gave us a pass to use expedited customs clearance. It was very short line, and customs and security took less than 5 minutes. The Seoul to LA leg was again in an A380. This time we sat in the main cabin which is 3-4-3 arrangement. We chose the centre section, so you are only 1 seat away from the aisle. Again, the food options were Korean or western and we chose the Korean option which was very good. I find the Asiana flight attendants to be excellent, friendly and helpful. We ordered wine with dinner, and in a vain attempt to sleep on the flight we asked for a second glass of wine. The flight attendant brought our second glass and several snack packets for both of us. I have heard some complain about hard seats on Asiana's A380's. I'm not sure that they are any worse than the economy seats on any airline. Frankly, in my opinion, spending 10-12 hours in any economy seat is tiring on my behind.

After a few more hours they decided they could not get the plane fixed or cooled down and sent all of the passengers away saying that you could either rebook on another airline (although there really weren't more than a couple of expensive seats on those other airlines) or get a hotel room on Breeze for the night. That's where the problems begin again.  I got a room at a nearby Holiday Inn Express, nothing lavish. Cost ~$135. After I book the room Breeze sends an email and says you only have 6 days to apply for a hotel reimbursement and $20 for one meal. My total very inexpensive meals were ~$80 for dinner and breakfast. Plus an UBER back and forth to the airport. Breeze  so far has only reimbursed me $20 and if I accept that payment I must click on an agreement that binds me to that settlement.

666,Breeze Airways,1,"""they don’t deserve one penny of your money""","This is the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. I saw a poster for Breeze in the Provo airport. I have flown on Allegiant many times between Provo and Phoenix for work, but no flight was available on my desired day of travel so I decided to give them a try. The actual flight was fine, on time, very clean new plane, no bells and whistles but I didn’t expect any, even though I paid $200 for a one way ticket including paying for my checked bag. And here becomes the issue. I spent over an hour in Phoenix baggage claim and my suitcase never showed up. Happens, right? Not like this. There is no one at a ticket counter, no one in baggage claim, NO ONE TO CALL. That’s right, they do not speak to their passengers by phone. My options to locate my bag were text, email or Facebook messenger (seriously). I would never have flown an airline that doesn’t provide customer service by phone had I known. I sent an email and text only to receive an automatic reply to please allow up to TWO WEEKS for a response. WHAT? I paid to check this bag and they lost it after an hour long flight and now I can’t contact anyone to find it. It’s so upsetting and appalling. As I began to inventory the lost items my panic, frustration and nausea grew. I have sent messages daily for the last five days, finally received an email with a lost bag claim number, no apology, no recourse, the email said I could text to ask about reimbursement to the number I already texted with no response. How can a business treat its customers like this? I don’t get it. I have worked in hospitality for 25+ years and this is just dumbfounding. What about brand loyalty? Repeat customers? Not if they don’t care enough to have someone answer the phone when losing their personal property! The worst part, staff in the departing, arrival and flight continuing airports have all told me that this happens all the time. They see people wander around baggage claim and then begin to realize their bags are gone and there’s no one to talk to, no one who cares. I’ve had substantially better treatment from the airport information desk than the airline I paid to entrust with my bag. Don’t fly this airline. The “economy” price is even that cheap and they don’t deserve one penny of your money.",Business,Economy Class,7/1/2023,3,3,3,1,1,2,Provo,Phoenix,True,United States,True,Domestic,worst airlin experi ive ever saw poster breez provo airport flown allegi mani time provo phoenix work flight avail desir day travel decid give tri actual flight fine time clean new plane bell whistl didnt expect even though paid 200 one way ticket includ pay check bag becom issu spent hour phoenix baggag claim suitcas never show happen right like one ticket counter one baggag claim one call that right speak passeng phone option locat bag text email facebook messeng serious would never flown airlin doesnt provid custom servic phone known sent email text receiv automat repli pleas allow two week respons paid check bag lost hour long flight cant contact anyon find upset appal began inventori lost item panic frustrat nausea grew sent messag daili last five day final receiv email lost bag claim number apolog recours email said could text ask reimburs number alreadi text respons busi treat custom like dont get work hospit 25 year dumbfound brand loyalti repeat custom dont care enough someon answer phone lose person properti worst part staff depart arriv flight continu airport told happen time see peopl wander around baggag claim begin realiz bag gone there one talk one care ive substanti better treatment airport inform desk airlin paid entrust bag dont fli airlin economi price even cheap dont deserv one penni money,-0.921,-0.005762987,Neutral,Negative

The plane made it to the takeoff spot then engine light came on. Sat and waited for tug to come take plane back to gate. Tug wouldn't work so another tug was called. Several announcements made regarding maintenance needed, last one said brakes need to be repaired. Sat at gate for awhile, it was 3:30 pm and was told no departure info available. Several of us asked to cancel and Breeze attendant said yes, your luggage would be taken off and we could pickup at carousel 3. Waited at carousel 3 for awhile, no luggage. No one had any idea where it was. Waited two days and no one knows where my luggage was. I was told I could buy clothes and toiletries and would be reimbursed. Received a text message saying my luggage went to Los Angeles, CA. Luggage showed up at my home over two weeks later since found. Luggage receipts sent three days to the Breeze telephone number they gave me to use. It was six weeks yesterday, I haven't received one penny of my money spent on clothes/toiletries. I have sent numerous messages to the ""one number"" they gave me to communicate with. They replied once and said they would review the receipts and get back to me within four weeks. It had been over six weeks and they stopped replying to me. They now send an autogenerated response that says thankyou for sending your receipts. There is no way to have human contact and their website doesn't provide any further info either. By the way, they don't have a way to provide reviews either. The whole Breeze Airline experience has been awful. No one accepts responsibility or even tries to make my horrible experience better. I know planes are delayed and luggage gets lost/mishandled but at least apologize and make things right after your policy and your employee states a reimbursement is allowed.

687,Breeze Airways,1,"""great flight in both directions""","I hadn't even heard of Breeze when I booked a non-stop round-trip ticket from Las Vegas to Richmond, Virginia. They had just added this obscure route. No one else offered a direct flight and they were $300 less then a similar flight that included one stop en route. Prior to booking, I checked out the reviews and overall rating, and prepared for late flights and lost luggage—none of which happened. Great value, excellent flight on a new Airbus A220. Excellent crew and in-terminal check-in staff, both in Las Vegas and Richmond. On both ends the flights left on time and arrived ahead of time and the baggage service was fast. Instead of using the terms economy and first-class, they offer: nice, nicer and nicest more inclusive terminology. With Breeze, you have to do everything online and my recommendation would be to first time flyers to set up a real account first (not a guest account) and book the ticket. I booked as a guest then setup a real account, but they can't merge the two accounts.

Once I made it to the gate, we were supposed to depart at 4:50. We didn't start boarding until 4:50 and were never given a reason for the delay. When we started boarding, it wasn't the plane we booked. It was much smaller, no first class or extra leg room seating. We just sat wherever we could.

The flight times are also convenient as well - unlike JetBlue, which showed its disdain for Richmond by scheduling its (since canceled) flight from Richmond to LA at 9 PM, Breeze schedules its west coast flights so that they leave east coast mid-morning and get back before it's too late at night. But what I really like is that upgrading to their Nicest cabin with a first class seat is very reasonable - maybe $100 each way. The ability to fly nonstop and in comfort makes Breeze a winning proposition. There are some things they could do better - there's no wifi or IFE on the plane, and the flights only run twice a week, so it's not always possible to use Breeze if your schedule doesn't match up.

This is my experience flying direct from Tampa to Norfolk and then Norfolk to Tampa a week later. I fly first thing in the morning and sat in the Nicer seats. Overall, no issues with the flight. The boarding process was very easy and go the seat with no problem. If you are a bigger person, you may need a seat belt extender. Just ask the flight crew right when you step on and they will give you one before heading to the seat. Once boarded the captain came out and spoke with the cabin and explained the flight. We took off on time and landed 20 minutes early. The fight was very smooth and couldn't have been happier. There are inflight refreshments but unless you are in the Nicest seats cost money. I flew back to Tampa in the Nicest seats and WOW! what an upgrade. For an extra fifty bucks having the extra width and leg room was fantastic. I sat in row 1 which provide extra leg room and at 6'4'' was more room then really needed. The seats are comfortable and have a reclining feature with a foot/ leg rest. Inflight refreshments come with the seat which include a can of soda and other beverages and snacks. The snacks are not the little airplane snacks but large bags of chips, candy, and energy bars. Overall, the staff was fantastic. The inflight stewards were professional and very nice and accommodating. The gate staff were also professional and prompt to load flights and get people on. The only things to remember: No in free inflight refreshments. Depending on your seat you will be allowed a personal item, carry on, or loaded bag. Some seats only allow a small personal item, and a carry-on bag will cost extra. Also I think the reviews related to delay flight and issues relate to a very limited number of aircraft.

Let me give you a hint, you have to walk a ways to find a tram that takes you to another gate. You should talk to someone because there’s no labelling. Flight was delayed two hours to depart at 10 instead of 8. I’m not mad about that part. Everyone was at the gate waiting and about 10 minutes after boarding was suppose to start they said the flight was delayed for another two hours. Four hours total! We weren’t given any reason and one person said this was unacceptable so they said over the intercom they’d call law enforcement to the gate if needed. Grow up.

750,Breeze Airways,9,"""Seats comfortable. Staff friendly""","I was skeptical of this airlines because of how new it was and seemed to be getting so-so reviews. So after taking my flight I felt the need to leave a review to help add another viewpoint to the system. Overall I would rate the experience 4.8 out of 5 stars, but have no problem giving them 5. I flew myself and my family, a total of 3 people, from Orlando, FL to our state home, non-stop, for under $450. This was in the start of spring break for many places and most tickets were 300-$400/person for other flights. Prices for Breeze did go up as the flight day came closer, but stayed under $150/person by the day of the flight. Any other airlines would have been significantly more expensive and had a connection flight, taking longer to get us home. The process on the app is fairly simple and making changes is easy as well. The first issue I had was the app can be a bit slow to update your gate location if it doesn’t have one yet. On the day of the flight we figured out what gate we needed to go to through google flights before the app informed us of the location. It did tell us well in advance though, about an hour out from boarding. It was fairly simple to find the main desks at the airport, but usually no one will be there until at least 2 hours prior to the flight, or at least that’s the case at MCO. Our flight was slightly delayed l, but that was because something delayed it before it arrived in Orlando, so it was just the domino effect. They did do their best to get things caught up, which only had us delayed by 10 min in the end. Boarding went fairly quick and we were quick to get up in the air. One of the captains actually grabbed the intercom that the flight attendants use and updated everyone on the status of everything while in plain view, before departing. I appreciated that personalized address, instead of the standard, locked in the cabin and talking to you from behind closed doors. During the flight, like most budget airlines, every snack and item will cost something. One surprise though is that entertainment is complimentary on our flight, but you’ll have to use your own device. You simply log in to their onboard Wi-Fi and select the “free” option which takes you to their website that offers a variety of movies, shows, and games at no charge. If you want more internet access options you’ll have to pay for upgraded internet. The seats were actually very comfortable for a budget flight. I upgraded us to extra leg room, or basically the first class seats for $30/seat. The seats just behind those though also looked similarly comfortable, but I did not look at the seats further back and don’t know if they’re the same or different the further back you go. Landing went smoothly and my checked baggage was delivered to baggage claim fairly quickly and didn’t have the appearance of being thrown in the ring with a wild bull, like some I’ve seen in the past with other airlines. In the end, I spent a total of $440 and that included 3 selected seats at $30/ea and one checked bag for $35. Flight for 3 people was about $169 and fees were around $146. Overall, I was happy with the airlines and will very likely use them again. Hopefully the experience will continue to be the same.

I have flown this airline for about two years solely because it gets me to where I need to go without a layover. However, I have recently decided that I would rather have a layover than fly with this airline. Not one of my flights over the years has ever been on time (or even close to on time). None of the staff ever knows what is happening and are basically completely useless. The app is God awful. They constantly have problems updating delays, and sometimes even say your flight has been moved up when it has in fact been delayed further.

We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta.

When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday.

Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU.

So I really wasn't expecting much. Just a whatever meal until I get to my destination. Well to my disappointment, on all of my transits flights I was only served one vegan meal, that is unacceptable. On the Atlanta flight to Frankfurt, I was served rice with a few vegetables for dinner, which was fine, no complaints there. Then comes breakfast time, everybody was given their whatever meal and I was told that they only have an apple for me, ""the flight attendance exact words to me were, ""well you a vegan right, I can only give you the apple."" I respectfully said no thank you to her. Everybody else was given their whatever meal which was a sandwich, yogurt and an apple.

Brussels Air manager in Dulles said computer no longer showed either of the two extra bags Washington to Brussels to Uganda. He said pay another $400 and they would refund. But they didn't refund and wouldn't answer inquiries about the claim several weeks later. Then they lost the bags in Brussels for two days and failed to track them on the computer when found. The Dulles baggage agent said Brussels Air is the worst handling baggage and might lose them for a week or two. I called Brussels again and found they were on their way to Uganda. Six hours after my call they were still shown as lost on the computer. Bags came a day late and we had to pay a taxi $200 to transfer them across the country to our destination. On return the Brussels - Washington trip was cancelled at the last minute after departure from Entebbe and they tried to send us through Frankfurt instead of switching to United/Brussels to DC. We complained and they permitted the United flight. But we had paid for economy plus and United didn't respect that so we had to pay again. We put in a claim on the day of departure from DC for the double charge on excess baggage but they didn't respond, and when we called after some weeks still didn't respond in spite of promises by the phone rep. They also didn't respond to a request to refund the economy plus fee for the cancelled flight Brussels to Washington, even though the replacement airline (United) didn't recognize the payment to them and charged it again. Their airport reps were friendly and helpful but the Brussels organization is extremely inefficient. They still use the bankrupt Sabena identifier SN.

We departed about 12 something for a flight that should have left at 7:15. We got to Jamaica told to make my mother in law walk to meet the wheelchair as none was waiting for her. Got down to immigration and to the baggage claim where one of my bag was not present. All the representatives were up and about trying to find stuff for people who could not find their luggage.

799,Cathay Pacific Airways,1,"""It has been a nightmare""","Paid extra for a good seat; Didn't get it due to weight balance but was promised refund the price difference before the flight; Wasted 10+ hours in nightmares with the Cathay Pacific customer service on whatsapp, emails, and phone calls, but it's still not resolved yet. I spent a few hundred dollars more on this 17 hour long trip, for a seat with good leg room and unobstructed view by the wing. However, I was told by the lady at the check-in counter that the seat had been changed by ""the people in Hong Kong"" for weight balance and she could do nothing about it. But she told me that the price difference can be refunded as long as I contact the customer service. And I believed her easily and thought that would be easy and not waste much of my time, because the fact that a paid service cannot be provided implies that that part of the cost should refunded. Or so I thought. The first customer service guy told me that it was impossible even before I could finish describing my situation. And he was also very ignorant of what services they are offering, and thought that one doesn't have to pay anything for extra leg room nowadays. I contacted again in emails, and the second person turned out to be a huge disappointment too. I was humiliated by a ""goodwill gesture"" of 10,000 Asia Miles that I will probably never use. And this guy even started to blame that it was their staff at JFK who changed my seat, which contradicted what I heard before the flight. And I am confused why that can be a good reason for not refunding me too, maybe by discrediting the check-in counter lady who told me that I could easily get a refund? After that I have spent more hours on emails and phone calls with their customer service. It has been a nightmare. More appointment and more humiliation. This is my first flight with Cathay Pacific, and I think the last one too. I don't know why it was a trustworthy airline in my impression, but not anymore. Regarding the inflight experience, I had a broken TV, a tiny unstable table with no beverage holder, and was in a location directly facing the toilet.

802,Cathay Pacific Airways,1,"""many touch points missed""","Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Travel is a gift. Every touch point should evoke a different sense of excitement and thrill. Air flights are the beginnings of many touch points, and options for comfort exist. International business class is not all equal. Here's my optic of Cathay Pacific Business Class LAX-HKG-BKK and the return BKK-HKG-LAX. How excited we were to by chance be able to save our vacation travel from headaches and fly Cathay Pacific. Originally, we were set to fly PAL Business Class thru Manila to BKK; however, the Taal Volcano threw us a curve ball four days before our journey was to begin. In desperately search for an alternative carrier that would align with existing connections in BKK as well as return accommodation in BKK, Cathay Pacific held the flights. Without hesitation we booked. Now, we are not novices to International Business Class travel. EVA is our most preferred carrier, but its flight schedule did not align with our awaiting connection in BKK. We had always said that we should fly Cathay Pacific to see how it compared. It was only just nine months earlier we flew PAL for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. With that being said, we were under impression that Cathay Pacific held one up on EVA. So, perhaps Cathay Pacific would be our new go to first before EVA. Let us begin. Flight CX881 15 Jan 20 LAX-HKG departed on time. That's always a good thing. The business seat though lacks lumbar support (see photo). The amenity kit was marginally stocked with a toothbrush kit, 15ml mouthwash, Bamford hand cream plus lip balm as well as hydrating face spray, sleep mask, and earplugs. Other marginal amenities were a pair of small disposal slippers that are not quite sized to accommodate a wide foot market and a comforter. No pajamas here folks on this long haul as EVA, but to be fair PAL lacks PJs as well. Good thing though I brought a heavy cotton sweater as the cabin is kept cold, like cold cold. You learn these little things as you travel. Not all carriers maintain comfortable air. Movie selection at first appears to be vast, but upon further review, Maleficent was the only recent movie. I'm not on top of trending movies, so I named Maleficent due to TV commercial exposure. The rest are older releases with some that are ancient. Ah, not something expected. Please take time to learn what customers are seeing at the movies. A note about the interactive monitor, it is sluggish to the point of freezing up at times while scrolling. What type of dated software operating system is being used? Just saying. The dinner options were typical. Local food with some Western. When the flight attendant came to take my dinner order, she asked if I would like the burger. She then asked if I would like the seared chicken breast. That received a no. She actually looks stunned and finally asked what I would like. I ordered fish ball tung choy choy soup. For beverages, I ordered French Burgundy and water. BTW, no flight attendant comes around asking if you would like more wine.  Dessert taken was cheese along with fruit, and I asked for a cordial Cointreau. Another look of like OMG I have to work. With the flight leaving almost at midnight, there was no pre cordial anything which was not expected either. So many touch points missed.

After over an hour and the usual escalation, the Tool gave me a phone number and email address to which JetBlue must present evidence that their flight was late so they'd release the tickets graciously without the fee, like any normal airline would any day. So, after 15 hours on nearly continuous phone calls in the airport, we got clearance to rebook, and Jet Blue put us on Cathay Pacific. Returning home, we checked our bags through to Orlando, knowing we'd have to clear customs & recheck them in NY.

But they ended up giving me the wrong seat anyway, rather than 40E, which is larger. They could not fix the issue on the plane, so I was stuck with the tiny seat and wasted my $30. Some seats can lift the armrest, but the one I had to go to could not and was quite uncomfortable. I then learned that this was the first flight I've been on that doesn't offer free WiFi. I had to pay $50 (specifically $43.90) to use their very bad WiFi service. The ""entertainment"" tablet doesn't work, even if you rub it or clean it, and there's nothing on there you've ever heard of, anyway. The food looked inedible, but that's okay because I opted not to eat anyway. It just sucks you have to pay for water, since TSA obviously doesn't let you bring any liquids on.

814,China Airlines,6,"""lounges are notoriously bleak""","San Francisco to Bangkok via Taipei. The seats on their 777-300 and A350 are excellent, wide and full lie-flat, and decent blanket. The seats are sturdy, so you can't feel movement by other passengers in neighboring seats getting up and down. Amenities are decent, and the cabin staff is attentive. Overall, though, this is at best a middling business-class product. Unlike other airlines, you don't get Champagne before departure, just a choice of apple juice, orange juice, or water. In-flight entertainment options are quite limited, with many movies and TV shows available only in Chinese. The food tends to be merely edible, and seldom appetizing or enjoyable. It's beyond me why they charge business class passengers for WiFi - there's nothing like paying upwards of $5000 for a single ticket, trying to log on to WiFi, and finding that you need to pay extra for WiFi access. As for ground service, China Airlines lounges are notoriously bleak. They're often quite crowded, and the food and beverage choices are ridiculously limited. (In Taipei, for example, they have 4-5 dim sum varieties on offer, some congee, and a couple of other Chinese offerings, such as a cabbage stir-fry dish. At the SFO lounge, the choices are vastly more limited. You'll get far better food outside in the terminal.)

All 4 segments of our flights went relatively well, there were no hassles and the fare we paid was good especially since this was for Christmas peak season. The San Francisco-Taipei and Taipei-San Francisco flights both were excellent but the Taipei-Manila and Manila-Taipei were okay. SFO-TPE: Check-in was a breeze and there were no hassles with the luggage although we were slightly overweight by a fraction. The B777-300ER plane we flew looks fairly new. We got seats 71H & 71K - perfect for couples. Food was good, service was decent. There were lots of entertainment options, movies, etc. and monitor was huge and resolution was sharp. Toilet was clean and I was told flight crew periodically clean it/wipe it down, which was well appreciated. They exceeded my expectations. TPE-MNL: We had 1.5 hours of transit time but lines were very long through security. Aircraft was A330 with a 2-4-2 configuration. We loved the fact that we were seated on a pair of seats as we like to keep to ourselves. Service was decent, nothing exceptional. Food was okay. There were some entertainment options on board including movies but since this was a 2-hour flight, it was not enough to finish a complete movie. The aircraft was also older and the monitor was smaller and not as sharp than the B777-300ER. MNL-TPE: Same aircraft as TPE-MNL with similar experience. My only unfavorable comment was that restrooms weren't clean on this flight. Some passenger completely made a mess in the entire lavatory and it appears flight crew do not clean this, possibly because it was a very short flight. TPE-SFO: Similar comments as CI003 SFO-TPE. We were seated on 70H & 70K. We really loved the pair of seats in the back. Again, food and service were excellent. No transit issues as we purposely took the 11-hour layover to see the city. However, immigration line took 1.5 hours - not good. Otherwise, the experience was good. Overall we were very pleased with our experience.

820,China Eastern Airlines,8,"""good food and service""","Hong Hong to Budapest via Shanghai. Flew on A320 on HKG to Shanghai while in a newer B787-9 on the long haul to Budapest. China Eastern marketed flights. The long haul leg was flown by their daughter company Shanghai Airlines to Budapest. Amazing experience, pure adventure. Bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to Europe as a huge bargain for 347 USD including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near X-mas. It costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which I volunteered as I needed the extra miles for my elite status. However, I was notified (2 months before travel) by my online travel agent (Travelgenio), that the return flight from Budapest was preponed by 1 hour. Then, I was forced to change as I would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure. I then decided to change plans completely and celebrate New Year in Budapest instead of Vietnam. Thus, I postponed my return travel from Budapest by 3 days. This was done by emails to the Travel Agent (no response) and then phone calls to Ch. Eastern in Brisbane and Shanghai. Eventually, it went smoothly and I was changed to my wish without added costs (apart from changing onward flights beyond Hong Kong with another airline). That even allowed me to do another, cheap detour to Hanoi on my way back to Hue. The homepages of China Eastern and Shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from. Unless one has a Chinese telephone number. However, 10 days before departure I could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats, even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat. However, one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with CE’s flyer program in which I am not interested. Apart from that it was a good adventure: a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong, but all went smooth. Arrived in Hongkong early and was able to check-in 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily. No queues at the check-in and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking English. Two BPs issued immediately. Flying HKG-PVG is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic. That give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving HKG and passing PVG. First flight was on an aged A320. Extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers. Onboard, newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered (bring own headset). Shared monitors showed some educational movies. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited (water, tea, coffee, beers), but only for 1 hour out of the 2½ hour long flight: during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 Minutes after kick-off and again 40 Minutes before landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. The second flight were by Shanghai Airlines’ Dreamliner. It was a very positive surprise and was faultless. Modern aircraft, good food and service, 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Individual IFE on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of Western and English translated movies. Toilets clean.

I used China Eastern airline for the first time, flying out Jan 30. I had problem at the airport when checking in, which never before in my traveling experience. My passport has printed out my first and middle name in short and not spelled out in full as in ticket. I showed 3 different government issued IDs to identify myself. The counter agent would not issue me a boarding pass and insisted that my traveling agent change my ticket name. When I called the traveling agent, they would take 2 days, and advised me to ask the airline agent at the airport to do that for me. However, the airport agent and her supervisor refused to help me at all. They were extremely rude to me, literally man-handled me to step aside so they can help other customer. I stood there for over 1 hr. Finally, I asked my traveling agent to book me with the different airline at the same day or tomorrow flight. When I asked the supervisor to do in writing that they refused to issue me my boarding pass and the reason, she came out later and told me that she can now help me correct the name on ticket to be exactly same as the passport. The aircraft was quite old, not a lot of comforting equipment. WiFi was not working, and when asked the flight attendant, she said will let me know when function return, but she never told me for the rest of 14 hr flight. Flight attendant never once ask what I need during the entire flight, I had to press call button and wait for 30 min each time I need something. In conclusion, the service was worst than economy class, despite being business class. On the way returning from Bangkok, I did not have any problem at the counter at all, although took extra 15 min to check in due to my name on passport again. The food was also just tasted like coming from a vending machine. Even though the ticket in business class is $1,000 cheaper than other airline, I will never fly with China Eastern again.

We're vegetarian so I requested for it since the day I purchased our tickets but for whatever reason the first meal they said we are not on the list of special request. We waited and later they came with a vegetarian meal. I am not very picky with food I tend to enjoy it even in the simplest way. Crew are nice too.

835,China Eastern Airlines,8,"""all pleasant throughout""","Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. My wife and I took a chance on our last trip to Asia and flew on China Eastern Airlines. The fare for the flights we chose on them were a few hundred dollars lower than what we were finding on more traditional Asian carriers. We booked our ticket through a third party platform (Justfly) in early October for a November 1 departure from Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. One thing that you will find out quick is that when you book your ticket through a third party, you are not able to then go back to the airlines website and check on the booking until the day before departure. You also cannot choose seats until, literally, you get to the airport and check in at the kiosk. This made us wonder if the booking ever happened. I even worked with Justfly to confirm and looked at my Credit Card bill in which China Eastern was indeed paid the money for the booking we made. So as far as I was concerned, on the day we left, there would be a booking. On that day, we went to the airport just a little earlier than normal to be sure that if there were any problems whatsoever, we could deal with them in time for the flight. What pleased me was that the booking was indeed in the system, our seats chosen and we could even change our seats right there. Another concern I had from reviews on this and other sites said that the bags would not be checked through to our final destination, meaning that when we got to Shanghai we would need to exit the airport, get our bags and re-check them into our Hong Kong flight. We were pleased that this was not the case and indeed, the bags were tagged for Hong Kong and, indeed, hours later upon arrival we saw our bags on the carousel there. Service on the flight was good. Coach class food that was served was perfectly fine. They did serve red wine on the flight and we enjoyed a variety of good food throughout the service to Shanghai, and then to Hong Kong. Keep in mind that the most safe food that one can eat is the food that is served on an airplane, so unless you are allergic to some ingredient that they use, you will find the food quite applicable and satisfactory. Later on when I was walking the cabin I noted a small bar in the galley that one could get a drink and a bag of peanuts. Aircraft was clean and seemed neatly taken care of, One thing that a passenger of a healthy girth may need to know is that the seat belts don't make it all the way. You will need to ask for a extender, which the crew happily gives upon request. The attendants spoke English as well as Chinese, and were all pleasant throughout the service we experienced. With more ""effervescent"" passengers, they still acted professional and held to standards at all times. The entertainment system at each seat had a decent variety of movies and the flight tracking program was as good as ones I have seen on American or Delta. Transfers at Shanghai for passengers going on another China Southern or Shanghai Airlines flight (the airlines are one in the same with Shanghai being the more ""basic transportation"" airline) are very straightforward, Just follow the signs to the transfer desk and go through security. Be sure to take out any electronic devices including power chargers for your phone - have them go through the X-ray without pulling out and most likely the security people will take the device from you with some excuse saying that it was too large or not applicable.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,11/1/2018,4,5,5,5,4,2,Honolulu,Hong Kong,True,Hong Kong,False,International,honolulu hong kong via shanghai wife took chanc last trip asia flew china eastern airlin fare flight chose hundr dollar lower find tradit asian carrier book ticket third parti platform justfli earli octob novemb 1 departur honolulu hong kong via shanghai one thing find quick book ticket third parti abl go back airlin websit check book day departur also choos seat liter get airport check kiosk made us wonder book ever happen even work justfli confirm look credit card bill china eastern inde paid money book made far concern day left would book day went airport littl earlier normal sure problem whatsoev could deal time flight pleas book inde system seat chosen could even chang seat right anoth concern review site said bag would check final destin mean got shanghai would need exit airport get bag recheck hong kong flight pleas case inde bag tag hong kong inde hour later upon arriv saw bag carousel servic flight good coach class food serv perfectli fine serv red wine flight enjoy varieti good food throughout servic shanghai hong kong keep mind safe food one eat food serv airplan unless allerg ingredi use find food quit applic satisfactori later walk cabin note small bar galley one could get drink bag peanut aircraft clean seem neatli taken care one thing passeng healthi girth may need know seat belt n't make way need ask extend crew happili give upon request attend spoke english well chines pleasant throughout servic experienc effervesc passeng still act profession held standard time entertain system seat decent varieti movi flight track program good one seen american delta transfer shanghai passeng go anoth china southern shanghai airlin flight airlin one shanghai basic transport airlin straightforward follow sign transfer desk go secur sure take electron devic includ power charger phone go xray without pull like secur peopl take devic excus say larg applic,0.9819,0.187202381,Positive,Positive

As it was booked through my company, you can't use the Condor App, web page, or Condor phone customer service to help you in anyway if you have an issue. Even when the booking company called Condor directly, which Condor said was the only way changes or seat selection could be made, Condor still said no.  I booked Premium Economy and then paid $50 on my personal credit card for my seat. The ticket itself was paid for by my company, I had to pay for the seat with my personal credit card. Then, 3 days before the flight, Condor changed planes and the new plane didn't have Premium Economy. Not sold out, but the new plane didn't have those seats at all and no refund for the $50 for my seat selection. My wife was traveling with me, she purchased her ticket directly from Condor, and no seat even though she paid $50 as well. My wife is vegan and selected a vegan meal. But  we are now on the plane in economy, and no vegan meal for her. She is allergic to dairy so her Vegan meal is not a choice, but a medical condition. Her ticket says Vegan meal, when she signs on to the app it says Vegan Meal, but when the Attendant looks at her list, there is no Vegan Meal. The attendant says ""it must have been lost because your seat was changed from Premium to Economy"". She brings my wife a banana for a 10 hour flight. Economy is the absolute smallest seat I have even flown. We flew on KLM's Cityhopper later on our trip which is an Embraer 190. Tiny plane with only 2 rows on each side.

The additional cost to us was over $ 5,813. I regularly followup with Condor Airlines about the status of our claim. Their response continues to ask for patience due to ""high volume of incoming mail"". The delay was not due to weather, and the counter and gate staff could offer no explanation.

The row right in front just had one passenger by the window, so I waited for the plane's door to close and I moved over, then an extremely unpleasant flight attendant came and told me to move back to my seat.

It was pretty embarrassing to be honest, the guy was on a power trip somehow, so I just sat back and kept my mouth shut, but the whole flight I had to be pushed to the aisle because there was just so much room for both of our bodies.  If I had the chance to be on my seat, I could just roll on to the wall and be fine, but nope. The choices I had was to look like a jerk and tell the 3 year old kid to move or to suck it up.

They threatened me with no letting me board my next flight and they confiscated my duty free even though other passengers offered to carry it for me.

888,Copa Airlines,3,"""Avoid if you can""","Leaving from San Jose to Panama City, my flight was delayed. There was much confusion and delay in updating the screens of letting the passengers know, they didn't have any satisfying or complete answers concerning any of us being able to get help in Panama with our missed layover to LAX. The flight crew in the cabin did admirably and only gave other passengers seemingly trivial problems. From Panama City to LAX, we had to wait hours after flying in to Panama before even knowing if we'd have flights or where people would be going before reaching their destination. The ground service was laughable, it was one man trying his best albeit not even close to being able to handle the situation with another service member focused on the next flight for the area & sometimes both of them were preoccupied with making announcements or just repeating details to passengers instead of helping us with our issue of being delayed, take that as you will. Others were upset that they would not even adhere to their policies and just intended to let people out to dry due to delays. They were not taking any responsibility for the situation, would not put people up in hotels anymore or give them shuttles or any similar accommodation because as I was told, this was ceased since Covid and that's part of their new restrictions (Allow people to just congest the airport due to delays while also having all over the airport you can't sit or lay down on carpet due to Covid Safety Guidelines) It was so contradicting and beyond that they charged for wifi past 30m unless you paid to stay in an overpriced lounge for 8 hours that I heard from a lady you couldn't even sleep in and they'd keep waking you up to prevent it. Those last two parts are more on the airport than airline but the entire thing was a grossly obvious shakedown. Copa is just aiding and abetting by stranding passengers there instead of helping them. All that being considered, after waiting for hours, I talked to a man that while he gave me questionable reasons for why they couldn't do much and aren't responsible nor had anything else to do than the bare minimum, I was not worried about these other issues as much, I was quite happy he was able to give me a boarding pass for the following morning for my next 2 connections ( I was going from SJO to Panama City to LAX and had my last layover there before finally one additional flight that was with another airline fortunately! ) and he checked all the other flights at my behest to see if I could find something faster or more reasonable. There wasn't but I appreciated the effort and in the SPECIFIC time frame I was talking to him, the speed of getting me what I needed and answering my questions, though I was prepared. All in all, they acted in a way that the idea of a delay was foreign to them, they didn't have any standard procedures to handle it, they had NO sufficient answers and generally no answers to your questions unless you knew what to ask.

The SFO to PTY flight was delayed by less than 1 hour and upon arrival at PTY passengers with connections received a US$10 meal voucher, which was nice. The PTY to MVD flight was on time.

I'm not sure how that can possibly happen on such an easy flight. We had to wait at the Delta baggage claim for 3 1/2 hours for them to finally tell us they would open a case. They had no idea where my mom's bag was. Our plan was to fly into Seattle, get a rental car and drive about 2 1/2 hours away to Ocean Shores.

935,Delta Air Lines,1,"""refuse to fly with them again""","I am a long-time Delta customer and have been loyal for many years, but I am going to cancel my account and will refuse to fly with them again. This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed, and we were told at the terminal that it would be ""at least an hour,"" and that it would probably be longer. I went to eat something and came back in an hour, and the plane was gone and the terminal empty. At the Delta desk, I was told it had gone. They said other people missed it as well. Of course, they had announced the flight over the intercom and sent passengers an email, but where I was told it would be ""at least"" an hour, I ate without listening to the many constant announcements or checking my phone. Delta booked me on standby for a flight late that night, but unfortunately did not inform me that it was an overbooked flight. There was no room on that flight. I had to travel late and stay the night in a nearby town and wake up the next morning for another flight, traveling on little sleep. I had to reschedule one of the most exciting meetings of my life with a new mentor. We met that night much more briefly, with me totally frazzled and stressed. So essentially, I spent extra money on food and transportation, lost sleep, missed work, wasted many hours, had to travel late and stay overnight, had a panic attack in the empty terminal, and missed a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a hero and new mentor of mine. I understand that these things happen and reached out professionally to Delta, and they emailed me apologizing and saying they would add 3,000 miles to my SkyMiles account. Turns out that 3,000 miles are worth about $30. I have seen overbooked Delta flights offer people credit cards for $500 or more, just like that. I lost so much time and money with this experience. I asked if I could talk to someone else, remaining friendly with the individual since I know it's a company policy and customer service staff are not to blame, but the email I got back said, ""Thank you for writing us back. I've utilized all my resources and have been advice by my leadership team that no further compensation can be issued. Regrettably we're unable to honor your request.

Especially since THAT flight was substantially delayed. Got in to DFW 6 hours later than planned. Return flight, delayed just enough that the only flight to be on time, the last leg, taking me home, was already pushed back when I got to the gate. Delta kindly rebooked me on a flight the next day and of course, no room. Fortunately the gate agent found a seat on a flight later that evening so I only have to wait 5 hours. I assume they used the same computer and data base that Delta Corporate uses, so I am not sure why the company didn't book me there in the first place. Going back a few months, I had a flight get delayed and delayed and then finally they sent me a text that it was delayed until the next morning. Same scenario, no help for accommodations and since they ""delayed"" it, well that's not the same as ""cancelled"" so they have no obligation to help or refund.

If you know the captain isn’t here or running late don’t squish everyone onto your cramped plane. Then I happen to be sitting next to the emergency exit and was trying to make sure I had the procedure of opening the emergency door solely by the illustration in the pamphlet when the delta lady butted into my conversation with my wife to correct me by mentioning the door will open itself after lifting the lever and I would go with it if I was still holding onto it. I jokingly said I guess I’d be the first off. Apparently her sense of humor is poor because then she threatens to move my seat and gets short with me. She said not to be snarky but she takes her job seriously. That’s fine I get taking you job seriously but learn how to communicate better and don’t come across like such a bitch maybe.

When I arrived I observed a chaotic situation without any social distancing and barely any resemblance to crowd control or customer service. There were many passengers that did not have their Covid-19 negative verification certificate printed out. Because we are in the digital age I can understand why passengers would assume that they would be able to just show an agent digital results on a mobile device. The agents were requiring passengers with their results on digital devices to print them there at the counter, Egyptair had a single laptop with a malfunctioning printer at a counter that all of the passengers had to share. Again, there was not any social distancing, no hand sanitizer, no assistance for passengers who were not computer literate and the male ticket agents had extremely bad attitudes. This created a situation of chaos. As a result of all of the chaos, some passengers missed the closing of the boarding gate including myself. I was told that I would not be able to board the flight and I was offered to have the flight rebooked for free. The gentleman at the counter told me that I would not have to pay a change fee. When I got to the counter to arrange for a new flight the attendant who was making arrangements for other passengers was charging what he called an upgrade fee. I watched him as he did this to three different passengers, with each of the fees being different for each passenger sitting in the same section. It was now my turn.

After asking, they refused to upgrade our seats. They also would not let us check in online, and so after arriving at the airport, we found out the new flight they put us on is not even a direct flight and was a multi-stop flight back to Cairo. Now we must find a hotel or place to stay in Cairo for the night since we are getting in 25 hours earlier than our itinerary.

My fiancé is Jewish and has an Israeli passport. While waiting to check in, we were questioned by 3 different people. I was pulled away from my fiancé twice for questioning. I was asked personal questions about my religion (if you are not Jewish, how are you planning to get married to a Jewish person ? (My fiancé is not very religious and we respect each other’s religions.) What Jewish holidays do you celebrate ? How did you guys meet ? Do you speak Hebrew? (Despite telling the El Al rep that I don’t speak Hebrew, I kept being asked to tell them what I know in Hebrew) How do you communicate at home if you don’t speak Hebrew? (We live in Australia and speak English) What will you be doing in Israel on each particular day (it was a holiday and we were planning to just take it easy). What are the names of your fiancé’s relatives? What do you do for work? Who paid for the trip? Eventually we were allowed to check in, but were told to meet El Al rep at the gate in 30 min, as he needed to speak to us for 5 mins before we board. No problem. We were at the gate on time. EL Al reps were not. We had to wait for another 30 min for them to arrive to the gate. After that we were taken to a small room with another 5 Non Jewish people. We were swiped for bombs twice. Our phones were swiped for bombs. Then El Al rep told us that they will take our bags away and search them in a different room (not in our presence). At this time my fiancé lost it and told them that if they are going to search our bags, then it has to be in front of us, as we have valuables in our carry on. Of course they refused and took our bags away. Later they came back with an unopened brand new iPhone that we bought as a gift for my fiancé’s mum and demanded that we unpackaged the box. Since it was a present, we begged not to open the brand new phone. Showed receipts from an apple store, but were told that we won’t fly if we don’t open the phone. We had no choice, and of course they found nothing. They never apologised for wasting 3 hours of our life and treating a simple couple on a holiday like criminals. That’s not the end of the story. When we arrived in Tel Aviv, we realised that our suitcase didn’t make it on the plane. It was still in USA. Luckily it arrived next day and we had to drive back to the airport, as they don’t deliver lost luggage like other airlines around the world do.

My son, who is just about 3 years old, suffers from Cerebral Palsy and is handicapped. His handicap is understandably difficult for him, as his parents, it is difficult for us as well. One of the most difficult times for us, and for him, is when we need to fly. My son is in a regimented routine within his therapeutic school / services and taking him out of the routine, into an area which he feels constricted (a plane) is very very challenging, but we do it often, to bring him to the US for special treatments. On Thursday (16/1/2020) my wife and son were returning from one of these trips abroad, following an intense week of therapies, evaluations, etc. This trip was different than others in that it was the shortest trip we have done and  it was the first time my wife and son were flying alone, without my daughter and I. At some point in the flight my son got very uncomfortable and began crying, loudly. My wife began the usual routine of holding him, walking with him, etc… trying to sooth and calm his nerves, but nothing was working. As this was happening, out of nowhere, our son began to throw up uncontrollably. My wife was shocked and started crying herself. At this exact moment a frustrated passenger got up and began verbally abusing her - yelling in front of the entire plane that she needs to get our child in check. My wife responded explaining our son’s challenges and disabilities, at which time others around her joined in, causing the abusive passenger to take his seat and quiet down. And here is where your team stepped up. Almost immediately my wife and son were surrounded by flight attendants, helping to clean the area, diffuse the situation, and even assisted my wife in cleaning up our son. The attendants continued coming with warm towels, blankets, and other items that they may have needed. One of the flight attendants even came and sat with my wife and son for about 15 minutes, talking and being supportive to them. She even offered to play with our son so that my wife could go clean herself up.

They could not fulfill my request for an aisle seat but the gate agent was gracious with his apology. On the return flight, I was seated next to an unaccompanied minor and the flight attendant was very attentive toward him, asking how he was and if he needed anything during the flight.

We asked to have the places changed, and a  rude lady told me the flight was full and she could not do anything for us, then when boarding she actually changed my fiance's seat to a more far away place. Once in the airplane, we discovered all seats were mixed up and everyone was trying to change seats and it was a big mess, we had more than an hour delay on the aircraft because people were being off boarded and their luggage needed to be found in the hold. We could not sleep in the plane because everyone was standing and even before we land the captain was begging the passengers to seat because they were already waiting with their suitcases.

1042,Emirates,1,"""refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage""","The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected.

1043,Emirates,1,"""no more Emirates for us ever""","I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes.

1059,Ethiopian Airlines,3,"""My experience was not a pleasant one to say the least""","I used the airline App to purchase a ticket one month before my travels from the United States to Ethiopia and was able to reserve a specific seat at the same time. I reserved seat 50L because of my high blood pressure condition. I needed to be seated away from any active passengers to ensure I would be able to have enough sleep which was necessary due to my medical condition. On the day of my travel to Ethiopia I went to check in and discovered my seat was changed from 50L to 13B which was next to children and was in the middle. I spoke with your ticketing agent at the airport who was not willing to assist me. I then spoke to a Manager who told me they are not selling seats but are selling tickets and that seat reservations made in advance didn’t really matter. I was almost crying because the airline staff were very rude and not willing to assist me at all. I feel they were calling me a liar telling me that I had not reserved seat 50L. Another passenger who overheard my conversation with your Manager gave me her seat which helped with my situation. Once I arrived in Ethiopia I went to the Addis Ababa office Which is the one in Addis Ababa to speak with someone concerning the negative experience I had with my seat reservation. Your staff member took my statement and I was told by her that I would receive an email containing the report your staff member had written. As of today, I have not received an email. I then asked her for assistance with my seat reservation for my return flight. She confirmed seat 50L was reserved for me and apologized for the negative experience I had on my flight to Ethiopia. Three days prior to my return flight back to the United States, I checked to confirm once again that I was seated in seat 50L. I then discovered that my seat reservation had been changed to seat 27B. I was really upset and when I contacted your airline I was told my seat had changed due to a change in the aircraft for the return flight. I asked why your airline does not send out an email when they change a passengers seat reservation, the agent on the phone for your airline told me that the best seat is always given to a Crew member. I was completely was shocked to hear that. I went to the Ethiopian Airlines office again to fix my seat reservation to what your agent had reserved for me. I spent three days of my vacation going from one office to another office to resolve my seat reservation problem as your App was giving me a system error. My negative experience with Ethiopia Airlines makes it less likely that I will use your airline for my travels to Ethiopia.

This was one of the dirtiest and least attractive airline lounges I’ve ever been in. We left within minutes of arriving. 2) Many of Etihad’s online systems both app and online - just don’t function correctly. It was not possible to manage any part of my booking online or via the app. Not possible to choose seats or check-in. 3) While the plane is beautiful, scratch and you’ll discover that beauty is only skin deep. Many of the new plane’s innovations do no function properly. Outlets don’t work, the silly built-in phone charger didn’t work, the entertainment controller was extremely unresponsive and didn't work effectively. Seat was not comfortable compared to other business class seats. 4) The bathrooms were not clean and did not function well. 5) Worst of all on this flight was the service. While the flight attendants were nice enough, they didn’t provide some of the basic service I'd expect even if flying economy. Glasses and water bottles were never collected, my empty coffee mug sat on my tray for almost an hour and no one ever thought to ask if I wanted a refill. 6) The cabin was kept ridiculously warm making it impossible to sleep. 12 hour flight without a minute of sleep.

So, to start off this poor experience they failed to inform their customers in a timely manner about these big changes. Next my new flight was booked for 5:30am the following morning. Eventually I was assisted at the Eurowings Discover desk and managed to get booked into a hotel about 10 minutes away from the hotel. The next morning, I had to make sure I was at the airport in time for my flight, meaning I had to wake up at 3am (bear in mind I only got to the hotel room at around 9 pm the night before). Leaving this early meant I missed my complimentary breakfast and I had to pay for my own transport back to the airport as the hotel’s shuttle service was not yet operational.

At the time I bought my return ticket Sydney - LAX, Fiji Airways was about 30-40% cheaper than its competitors (United, Qantas etc.). Some reviews made me a bit hesitant to fly Fiji Airways, but I am glad that I did! The online check-in was easy and their ground personnel at the baggage drop counter was friendly and helpful. Also the boarding went smooth and all four flights I had departed on time. On one of my flights, just before take-off, a steward came to me and asked me whether I preferred to move to another seat that had an empty seat next to it, because of my height (6 foot 6/1.95 m.). I think this was very kind of him and in general I found the stewards on board very friendly and willing to help. The food and the in-flight entertainment was alright. It may not be as fancy or shiny as the food and entertainment you get at huge airlines like Emirates or Qatar, but for the money it was good value. For the meals you had a vegetarian and non-vegetarian option and the in-flight entertainment was sufficient. (again, Emirates may have a 150 movies to choose from and Fiji only 30, but you can't watch them all anyway) Also the seats were fine and just like any other company (besides maybe the more luxurious A380 seats). I would really like to recommend Fiji Airways to fly with if you want a good value for money.

Sadly, COVID restrictions at the time had caused going to Norway to be problematic for US travelers; we would have had to quarantine for the trip and not travel the country, even with vaccination and boosters and negative tests. Finland was fine, but Norway was not. The trip would have been wasted. That said, I emailed and tried repeatedly and in multiple formats to get my flights edited well within the 24 hours that is required Finnair. I found that: 1. Finnair would not answer their chat bar, so I could not have cancelled or changed on time since no one responded. 2. Finnair did not respond to web messages, so I could not have cancelled or changed on time since no one responded. 3. The Finnair CEO confessed via mass email that the company had been non responsive, so I could not have cancelled or changed on time since no one responded. 4. I went to the airport to try to get the Finnair airport service desk to help – no one was there, so I could not have cancelled or changed on time since no one responded. 5. Finnair’s change policy states “in case you would like to cancel your booking, a refund will be according to the original ticket rules.” This was obsolete since no one called, emailed, or messaged back.

Those of us who live in Finland choose Finnair even though it's typically twice the price of Lufthansa or KLM, but we do it for tier benefits and because our companies typically allow it and don't mind the high prices. But then this is the reality. Two months and about 8 emails back and forth with their customer service and I only have points for 2 legs of the flight of 4 in total. Non responsive (or rather non existent) customer service, talking to a different person every time, being re-directed to other departments etc etc. I filed an official complaint on their website now and guess what: after clicking 'submit' the screen is stuck on the 'creating your case' window. Very Finnair. They don't have any proper customer service. It has always been an airline that charges premium prices but the service has always been questionable. In the past few years it has become just non existent. Just imagine, if those of us who have Gold status and have a special email we can reach out to, if we can' get any service, then I can't imagine what it's like for regular travellers. It is so frustrating. They take advantage of Finnish people and charge insane prices. And OK, we can even accept that, but that you then don't even get the benefits is really, I don't know.  For instance, the gold level awards you 4 business class upgrades. But they will almost never allow you to cash those in. If there are available business class seats, you can buy them, but if you want to cash your upgrade in then the answer is no, no availability.

1114,Finnair,2,"""airline removing customer service""","Another airline removing customer service. On a business trip to St. Petersburg, Russia for a week, decided to pay a little extra for flexible tickets in case I would finish up early - and I did. Go to the Finnair site a few days ahead of return tip, select an earlier flight and get told the fee for the new ticket would be 0 - excellent. When confirming the change a generic error message comes up, and the site does not allow me to do anything further. I immediately try contacting their customer chat but after navigating the chatbot menus for a few minutes it puts me in line for an operator then immediately hangs up because the volume of requests is too high. The next day I log on to their site again, and this time my new flight shows up under the booking - great! I then reasonably assume the change went through as planned, and that the error only came at a later step in the process. A few more days of my trip pass until it's time to check-in, and only when trying to do so does another error message appear telling me I can't check-in and to contact Finnair specifically at a number in Finland. Obviously calling an overseas customer service number is pretty annoying with queues and all, but I do so and spend 30 minutes waiting to no avail - no queue number is given, only that they are currently receiving an exceptional number of requests. At this point I am running out of time but feel my best bet at actually getting service will be at the airport counter itself, so I make sure to arrive there with an hour extra to spare. There is no Finnair staff at the airport, but the local Russian ground staff are very helpful - basically explaining that the system says I need to pay a EUR100 fee to complete the rebooking. This was not the info I was given on the Finnair site when requesting the rebook, and does not make sense with my ticket category having free rescheduling, but after spending 90 minutes at the airport trying to sort this out - with both ground staff and myself trying to reach Finnair - I relent and pay the extra fee instead of missing my flight entirely. I obviously know it will be a nightmare to reclaim this from the airline later, but I swear to at least try. On my return flight I have a connection in Helsinki, Finnair's home airport, so here I figure at least I can talk to their staff in person and get a little more clarity. I don't have time to leave the security area and seek out the ticketing office, but I track down two of Finnair's transfer desks at least, but they are both unmanned! Since returning home last night I have tried their chat twice more, again I get disconnected immediately because the volume of requests is too high. I obviously cannot find an email address to contact them at, and I simply don't have the patience to be in a phone queue for hours.

1130,Frontier Airlines,1,"""met with great difficulty via the app""","It wasn't that the voucher number didn't work, but rather that there was no time/place to enter it throughout the new transaction on your website/app as per instructed in the voucher email. The only thought I have is that the app went through a new update as the one I have been using the past few days clearly had a new interface and somewhere in the translation, the process was changed or buttons not added properly in the html etc... prior to launch? My hope is that the voucher can be added to the flight I already purchased for tomorrow. In other news, while attempting to cancel my earlier flight from today, I was met with great difficulty via the app (possibly resulting from the aforementioned update?) After going in many circles with the chatbot and waiting something like 35 min for a representative to arrive on the chat, I got frustrated and began searching for a phone number online to which I found a number claiming to connect me to the Philadelphia airport Frontier desk, but rather, connected me to a third party scammer who ended up ""canceling my flight"" with you somehow (likely getting a refund of some sort themselves) while simultaneously charging me an additional fee to cancel. While I don't expect any kind of reparations for that as it was a result of my own impatience/frustration. I'm guessing by my talks with other frustrated customers, that they are equally frustrated when trying to resolve issues with your airline, which can't be good for business. Having been a supporter of your airline in the past and knowing of your former bancruptcy claim, and fully understanding the role of chatbots, etc.in today's society; I fully believe that an investment in more customer care personel, empowering those people to resolve things beyond the standard voucher system and realistically solving all the other issues with unreliability that seemingly are plagueing your airline as of late so that the necessity for resolvement becomes negated is the only way through your current situation.

1137,Frontier Airlines,1,"""the worst flying experience""","By far the worst flying experience of my 45 years. The first flight from O Hare was canceled after multiple delays, and they finally agreed to reroute me through a city 200 miles from there! Since I was expected at my destination, I took it. 2nd leg had a slight delay also, but I got there 24 hours after expected. 2. Flight back had 2 legs as well. 1st leg again delayed. No mention of 2nd leg was made by staff, but the layover time was enough that I made it. Or so I thought. The flight from Atlanta, which was supposed to be at 10:27 PM, was announced as delayed to 11:20 PM. OK, I thought. No biggie. At 10 PM, they announced it was delayed to 2 AM because they didn't have staff. Here's the kicker. If they found staff, they would leave earlier. So passengers couldn't move from the gate. No meal vouchers for this 4 hour delay. Clock kept ticking. 12:30 AM, I went to get some coffee. Came back. The board at the gate says departure at 12:25 AM. All passengers were still waiting, but I panicked and asked the agent, and he says, sorry, mistake. It's at 2 AM. Then, all gate agents left. 1 AM, 1:30 AM, 2 AM... 100-plus passengers are at the gate desk, calling out for someone to come and update us. I started talking to their online agent.  No customer service telephone line. It takes 15 minutes to get one online. He closed the chat unexpectedly. Ok, let's say it was an accident, but given their behavior this far you get the point. I try again. It takes 10 minutes. The agent says all their systems are down, and she can't tell me what's happening with my reservation. I tell her, I'm asking for flight status. Surely, you have that. Or air traffic control would have something to say. She keeps repeating all systems are down, and she cannot tell me more. I ask for a supervisor. She won't get me one. 3:15 AM, someone shows up at the gate desk and says they're just waiting for pilot. Passengers are really panicking by now and asking why we aren't being kept informed. The 2 agents who came out smirk at the crowd and say they don't have to let any of us fly. They say the pilots have to wait out the time before they can fly again and ask all of us to move to a different gate. Okay, passengers agree, and we walk. 3:27 AM, I get a text saying flight is at 3:30 AM. Then, gate agents leave again from the new gate. They come back around 4 and say flight canceled. We can go to ticketing counter to get refund or reschedule. Oh, you also have to get your checked in luggage. If you know Atlanta airport. I get my luggage and go to the ticketing counter all the way at the terminal entrance. Huge lines. They say next flight to anywhere in Illinois will be in 2 to 3 days. At that point, I ask how much will I be refunded, because another ticket booked with another airline for just that short leg would cost 3 times as much. Answer is: I don't know.

Didn't give us any reasons on why the flight is cancelled. After waiting in line for more than 2 hours, finally got a chance to speak to the agent at the customer desk. She was the only one who was dealing with all the passengers. She was miserable, and didn't care what the passengers were going through. I was told by her that there is no alternative to get to destination for the next 48 hours. I even requested her whether I could get a flight back to LAS, to which she denied. When asked for other options, I was told I could cancel the itinerary for full refund, and that too I have to claim for it online. Given no choice, I left the desk, filed for refund, and booked a different airline at that last minute for a whopping price to reach the destination. Later I came to know that only a partial refund was issued on my itinerary, I got flabbergasted looking at the email. I filed a complaint with the customer service on the deception.

The flight left within 15 minutes of departure, which is considered on time in the industry. We arrived on time in CLE. Contrary to recent news reports, the gate agents were not enforcing bag size/weight check at the gate when my mom and I were boarding the plane. Frontier got new seats and these a lot comfier and better than the old seats, now with a better sized tray table! It’s nice to have a direct flight to CLE from SAN for us. Far better and calmer experience than LAX. It was a great July 4 experience!

1195,Frontier Airlines,1,"""not worth the cheap ticket""","On June 26, 2023, my flight to Trenton NJ, via Raleigh Durham, was cancelled. No explanation was given, but we found out later it was due to severe thunder storms. This can't be helped. We were told at the gate to go back to the ticket counter to re-book or cancel. I went to ticketing and asked a Frontier agent where I needed to be for re-booking. Her response was ""Over there"". She didn't indicate where 'over there' was, so I asked again. Same response. I said, ""Do you mean behind this woman (who was in line)?"", and she said ""No. Over there where the person in green is standing"". So I moved over to the end of the line. One by one we were moved to another line for rebooking and after about 30 minutes, I, too, was moved. I stood there for another 20-30 minutes when a Frontier employee walked over to us and informed us that if we were to re-book, we needed to be in the original line, the one we'd all just left. I tried to ask him if we were expected to go to the end of the line, but he interrupted me and said he would answer question once we all moved. I tried again. Same thing. Another passenger tried for clarification, and again, the very rude response. And once again, someone tried to ask, and once again, he interrupted before the gentleman had a chance to get his question out. I finally said that I was not going to the end of the line because I'd already been there once, and he then told me, ""Then you won't be re-booked"". Not one of us was angry or rude or disrespectful. We were appalled at his behavior toward us but no one was complaining about the cancelled flight or the long line. Some folks had been there for two days. Of the dozen or so standing around me, we all commented to one another that we would never fly Frontier again. After moving over to 'the other' line, I went back to the Frontier employee and asked his name. He interrupted again, saying he'd answer questions when we were all in line. I told him I didn't have a question other than could I please have his name. At that point he looked at me and said, ""I don't have to give you my name"". That's when I cancelled my ticket. Never, in my 72 years, have I witness such complete and utter disrespect to a group of people, and for no reason. Frontier Airlines deserves the terrible reputation it has. It's run on a bate and switch mentality. Just take a look at it's website. It has absolutely no regard for it's customers. Try finding a phone number where you can actually speak to someone. It's airline employees must hate their jobs, if their 'customer service' is any indication. I'm fully aware that these employees had probably had a couple of tough days, but what about the woman in front of me who had been trying for two days to get back to her kids? There was no respect or regard for her at all. This was my first and last experience with Frontier. They should be ashamed of themselves for the total lack of professionalism they display. I wonder what corners they cut on their aircraft. It's not worth the cheap ticket. Life is too short.

1219,Hawaiian Airlines,9,"""really carry the spirit of Aloha""","Hawaiian Airlines is really the airline to fly with between the Hawaiian islands. There was a hiccup on my experience but it was handled very well. Terminal 1 in Honolulu had been completely refurbished from the last time I had visited 10 years ago, and feels very modern, airy and welcoming, but less ""island-style"" - simple and relaxing, which is what the other airports around Hawaii feel like. Security took less than five minutes, and there was plenty of seating at our gate. I had two trips with Hawaiian, from Honolulu to Lihue/Kauai and Honolulu to Kahului/Maui. Both these flights are what I would describe as ""up and down"" flights, literally 3 minutes after we reached cruising altitude we already started our descent. One of the funniest things that I realised was that on both trips, the flights out of Honolulu was operated by the same aircraft (N483HA) and left from the same gate A19. When I asked the gate agent on my second trip about the aircraft's registration, I told her ""I flew this exact plane and left from this exact gate to Kauai two months ago!"" She was extremely nice and joked that I should buy it, since it was ""my plane."" That really made my day. Onboard, even though these aircraft are around 20 years old, they did not feel too old, and the 2-3 seating configuration is great for couples and families. I definitely recommend choosing an A window seat when departing from Honolulu to get a great view of Waikiki beach. The seats themselves actually don't recline and have a small drinks tray - no way you could get any work on your laptop done. Considering the longest flights these planes do are 45 minutes, I don't see any issue with the bus-like seats. The surprising thing is that during these ""up and down"" flights, the flight attendants still come round and offer passengers water, juice or coffee, the latter only on morning flights. Even with the limited service due to the short flight time, I still had great interactions with the flight attendants. The return from Kahului/Maui was a bit of an issue, where all the flights that day got delayed due to a storm in Honolulu. I went to the check in counter to ask if they could rebook me onto an earlier flight, and I was rebooked at no extra charge. Hawaiian Airlines' operation has a lot of quick turnarounds giving very little leeway for delays, the knock on effects went on for hours. However given how quickly the agent was able to rebook me onto an earlier flight (and luckily I didn't end up in a middle seat) it shows that they can handle a crisis very well. Indeed the flight they had rebooked me onto was still delayed, but it meant I got into Honolulu an hour earlier than if I was still on my original flight. Overall, Hawaiian certainly excels in terms of its product, and beats other US regional carriers by miles. They really carry the spirit of Aloha onboard and I would definitely choose them over Southwest when flying Inter-Island, except if I needed to check any luggage.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,4/1/2023,4,5,5,5,2,2,Honolulu,Kahului,True,United States,True,Domestic,hawaiian airlin realli airlin fli hawaiian island hiccup experi handl well termin 1 honolulu complet refurbish last time visit 10 year ago feel modern airi welcom less islandstyl simpl relax airport around hawaii feel like secur took less five minut plenti seat gate two trip hawaiian honolulu lihuekauai honolulu kahuluimaui flight would describ flight liter 3 minut reach cruis altitud alreadi start descent one funniest thing realis trip flight honolulu oper aircraft n483ha left gate a19 ask gate agent second trip aircraft 's registr told flew exact plane left exact gate kauai two month ago extrem nice joke buy sinc plane realli made day onboard even though aircraft around 20 year old feel old 23 seat configur great coupl famili definit recommend choos window seat depart honolulu get great view waikiki beach seat actual n't reclin small drink tray way could get work laptop done consid longest flight plane 45 minut n't see issu buslik seat surpris thing flight flight attend still come round offer passeng water juic coffe latter morn flight even limit servic due short flight time still great interact flight attend return kahuluimaui bit issu flight day got delay due storm honolulu went check counter ask could rebook onto earlier flight rebook extra charg hawaiian airlin ' oper lot quick turnaround give littl leeway delay knock effect went hour howev given quickli agent abl rebook onto earlier flight luckili n't end middl seat show handl crisi well inde flight rebook onto still delay meant got honolulu hour earlier still origin flight overal hawaiian certainli excel term product beat us region carrier mile realli carri spirit aloha onboard would definit choos southwest fli interisland except need check luggag,0.9828,0.118518519,Positive,Positive

1226,Hawaiian Airlines,1,"""felt so helpless and disregarded""","The flight was a connecting flight to Seattle, WA from Honolulu HNL connecting in Maui OGG. The Maui to Seattle flight was delayed by over 4 hours and we were not informed or notified in any manner. We had arrived from Honolulu and were waiting by the gate when we noticed the departure time change. I was traveling with my wife and 9 month old son and we did not expect this and didn't know what to do since this was our first time travelling with him. My wife went to inquire about the situation and was told by the manager/chief at the gate desk and they said ""there is nothing we can do"". She was worried because we did not have any baby food left or formula and it was frustrating. I went to speak to the same manager/chief and ask if we could get any assistance because we would have to sit in an airport with an infant for an additional 4 hours on top of the initial 2 hour of our flight. While I was talking to them they called security and threatened to get us thrown out of the airport because manager said she will not speak to us because ""we could not understand even is she tried to explain it"" I believe she was trying to imply we were incapable of understanding her and we need to move out of the way so she can help other customers. Shas just gotten another frustrated customer who was yelling and screaming at her and being hysterical but she gave her a completely different treatment and gave her another flight since she was from there and decided to flight out another time. We stood back and record while the security arrived and started questioning us. This was so frightening for us. We didnt know what was going to happen to us. Were we going to get arrested? were they going to take out infant son from us? what were we going to do in a place that is foreign to us and we did not know anyone there so thats where we were recording for our own safety. We decided to wait it out because it felt like the more inquiries or help we requested it was met with aggression and complete disregard of our infant child.

1228,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""stressful and unnecessary situation""","This was such a stressful and unnecessary situation. My husband is Navy and we were stationed in Hawaii in February of this year. Hawaii has very strict pet laws, so while I got all that sorted, our cat lived with a friend on the mainland. I finally booked a flight with Hawaiian Airlines for May 5th for my friend to fly our cat out to be with us, and just to double check that I had all my ducks in a row, I called their customer service line. I went over everything with the representative on the phone, including asking her specifically if our cat was good to fly on this flight and she said yes. I even offered to pay for the ticket ahead of time, which is insane that they don't let you do that, it is first come first serve since they only allow 4 pets on the plane at a time. We get off the phone and I am content that I did everything I was supposed to. My friend drives an hour and a half to Atlanta airport, gets there at 3:30am for her 6am flight, and the front desk denies a ticket to our cat. All they can tell us is that there is an error in their system and they cannot book her a ticket. They were incredibly incompetent. I was on the phone with her the whole time listening. They were rude to my friend and told her to just go the gate without a ticket for our cat! They held her up so much that she had to run from the train to her gate, and then come to find out they had the wrong gate printed on her ticket so she missed the flight anyway! We got on the phone with customer service and mind you, it's 11pm where we are. We then spend the next hour explaining what just happened and asking Hawaiian to fix it, and eventually they get us to a very nice manager named Joyce who helped us schedule another flight for the same day at 10:35am. Time comes for our friend to buy the ticket for our cat for the new flight, and the same problem happens. It took another hour for us to get a straight answer from front desk; Hawaiian Airlines had booked both flights with JetBlue as the first leg of the flight, and Hawaiian Airlines does NOT allow connecting flights with other airlines to carry pets. You'd think a manager on the customer service line might know that before booking our tickets and wasting more of our time. So if she had made it to the gate in time, they still would have turned our cat away. At that point we told our friend to just go home. My husband stayed up until 8am on the phone with their customer service trying to get them to fix us another flight for the next day, but they told us the only way they could do it is if we purchased two separate round trips and arranged for the times to line up. There are no nonstop flights to Hawaii that allow pets that fly out of Atlanta, so she would have had to stop in Seattle. There are so many risks involved in buying tickets that way, not to mention possible delays, going back through TSA when she lands in Seattle and the fact we did not want our cat in a carrier for that long. In the end we just asked for a refund. They gave us an additional $70 (whoopie) for wasted time, and apologized for the ""miscommunication"". We are booking another flight with Alaska Airlines instead. I was devastated, sobbing in the middle of the night because I have been so stressed out planning this for months , and they ruined it in the last hour. Never ever using them again.

1248,Hawaiian Airlines,1,"""You could not pay me to take one of their flights""","I have been traveling for 30 years and can't express with words just how bad my experiences with Hawaiian Airlines have been. My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii every January for the past 15 years and every year I contemplate hiring a boat to take me from island to island rather than dealing with this lousy airline. My most recent experience, I had booked two one-way tickets (Maui - Kona and Kona - Honolulu). My plans changed and I only needed the Kona to Honolulu portion of the trip. Rather than being able to make this change online I used chat, text and three phone calls. After more than 2 hours, I was told by the agent that I had to cancel this ticket and then rebook it completely. I said, ok and asked the agent to rebook the flight for me. I was then told that they couldn't rebook it, but I had to use the credit voucher online. After waiting 48 hours, and no credit voucher appearing in email, I logged in and tried to find the credit. Another two hours of waiting for a chat agent, only to be told that I couldn't book this online and had to speak with an agent. Ok, I call the number....90 minutes later, I'm told that ""because I called an agent, they were going to charge me $25 for each ticket for a processing fee."" So, my ticket that had a value of $116 per person, and I was trying to rebook a new ticket for $39, and I was going to immediately lose the remaining value of the credit, was really only saving me $14 off of just abandoning the original ticket and rebooking online. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my years of traveling. Unfortunately, they have a monopoly when it comes to inter-island travel so you have to use them which I guess is why they can get away with providing such lousy service.

It started with them canceling my husbands and I’s flight during Covid and not offering any sort of voucher for a last minute hotel. If you can imagine, getting a hotel day of on Honolulu is the worst. Talk about cockroaches and a nasty bed. Not to mention being put on hold for 3 hours only to give up, call back later and be put on hold again for hours. That was in 2021. Later that year we purchased tickets and they were unable to check us in as though our tickets never even existed. que going to the “services” line in the Honolulu airport and coming close to missing our flight - not because we weren’t early but because the wait in the line was nearly out the door. And the employee barely knew what she was doing so everything took forever. If you’re unable to do the job properly you need more training. Now I go to check in in 2022 and they got rid of the check in lines all together and have kiosks and people walking around- you weigh your own bag etc. remember this is all at the Honolulu location. If you have an issue- just go wait in a line for hours and miss your flight. They got rid of free check in bags for military spouses (no other airline does this) the customer service said because they have “issues” with people sneaking bags or something - no, it’s clearly cutting corners. Active duty personnel is still allowed to have free checked bags but they have to go to the line that take 3 hours to simply have one checked bag. So they make you really contemplate if that free checked bag is worth missing your flight! Also all of this with no heads up with changed in policy’s.

Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dial-in hotline said that’s where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son (and us) would be comfortable. First, there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second, arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seats… If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance, I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh well… nothing the flight stewardess/stewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air, we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. We’ll it happens… Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point, I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask- “So, what are the options now?”. Answer now is “You’ll get a room, meal vouchers and then come back for a 1:45pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and it’s going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morning… what are my options? Answer was “well you can take the room and voucher or not… that’s up to you. If you want a refund, you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever, we’re now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time, lost money in other bookings, transportation, etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was “file a complaint”. In conclusion- planes are old and tatty.

I called in, explained that their website keeps error out upon using the discount. The rep told me that they ""are aware of it"", Reasonably enough, she offered to give me one time courtesy of not charging me $25 for using the phone service. Not until the price they offered me is ~$200 extra per person than the web pricing! Luckily, I did the math, and told her that, with the price they are offering me, I am probably better off buying the same tickets online without the $100 companion discount - What a trap! I insisted she to talk with her manager for at least matching the website pricing since I had to call in due to their website error. About an hour later, the rep did call me back, offering a much lower pricing than their first offer. I made the purchase. Only then, I noticed, adding taxes and everything, the actual discount I got is only $61 than my original website pricing, not the $100 discount as their ""earned discount"" offer of $100. Their explanation is: The base pricing for the ticket, since our phone conversation to get the $100 discount took so long (~3 hours), has gone up from $496.56 to $562! So, the actual cost for me to call in is more than the $25 phone change cost since their website didn't work. Yes, the website problem which should cost them in fact cost me instead!

1287,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""Little about this flight was impressive""","We recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and we wanted to fly to HNL, where we spent our Honeymoon. We purchased First Class R/T tickets on Hawaiian Airlines. Not much about the experience was impressive, and I wish we'd given that $7,000 to the Ukrainian war effort. The agent gave us the gate number but said nothing about the need to line up at the gate and be checked in for a wrist band to avoid having to get screened once we arrived in HNL. About 20 minutes prior to departure we realized that people were queuing up and receiving wrist bands, so we got in line. After having been in line for about 15 minutes, the same agent who had taken our bag at the ticket counter advised those of us still in line that it was too late to be issued a wrist band and walked away. Not only had all of the extensive online pre-clearance effort been a waste of time but we only ended up boarding the flight a few minutes before the doors were closed prior to departure. I was livid before we left the gate and worked hard to not let such a poor showing on their part ruin our vacation before we left the ground. Little about this flight was impressive. The lie-flat seats belong not in first class but in an intermediate class of service. They are 6 abreast in the cabin. The lack of wi-fi at this juncture is inexcusable. iPads for entertainment? Really? Were we eligible to use the first-class lounge? What about the frequent flyer miles? Where would we find them, and can we have Delta FFMs instead? And then there was the food. Two chicken thighs with the skin on in a forgettable sauce was in-edible for me, I never eat dark-meat poultry. That was the extent of the food until breakfast, which wasn't much better. There were no snacks served in between on a flight exceeding 10 hours. Had my wife not brought her extensive survival rations that she typically takes when she flies to Asia, we would have been starving by the time we got to HNL. The return flight was equally pathetic--essentially Chef Boy-R-Dee ravioli without the sauce. It was tasteless and so dry we couldn't eat it all, and it was not a generous serving. Breakfast: also pathetic, we stopped and ate at First Watch on the way home. Like the food, the service was forgettable. Actually, it was nearly non-existent. If you don't ring a call button you won't see a Flight Attendant between meal services. Beverage choice in First Class is quite limited. Hawaiian offers a level of service that resembles Southwest Airlines. Do not under any circumstances purchase a first class ticket. Neither their Agents nor Flight Attendants are trained to provide that level of service. Their cabin interiors are dated and not adequately maintained. There is no WiFi. In Flight entertainment is via iPad, which must be purchased in coach. There is little customer service available from the company - virtually nothing in real time. I've been waiting for a response from them via their website for over a month, which is why I elected to post this online. We liked the fact that we could fly non-stop between Orlando and Honolulu; for less money we could have flown on Delta and, given the lengthy maintenance delay on our return flight we would have spent no more time had we connected in any of their hubs.

The food was amazing, the service was wonderful, and the lay-flat seats were glorious. I am grateful for their mask and vaccine mandate as it made me feel safer since this is my first time traveling again since Feb of 2020. The trip back from Honolulu to LAX was good, but this time the food was disgusting. They are supposed to have some serious chefs that do their food and I would have given them kudos for the first trip. But the food coming back tasted about as good as it looked. It was supposed to be coq au vin (wine-braised chicken) with green onion chickpea cake. Well, the chicken was the stuff you leave after stripping away the meat from the chicken - the left-over giblets with gristle, fat, and skin. Yuk. The green onion cake had absolutely no flavor at all. You might as well have eaten a piece of the polyester pillow. And those little bitter mushroom things that looked like worms? What are they thinking? Seriously. A true chef understands that there must not only be flavor, there must be a visual appeal. This meal ruined the entire trip and tasted about as good as it looked. I nearly got sick to my stomach. My mother (who usually eats anything) also thought it was repulsive. YUK!! Overall I love Hawaiian airlines and I would fly with them again but they need to get a grip on the food.

On my previous trip, the flight was delayed by 12+ hours. Due to this, we received travel credits of $300 each for the next flights. Now trying to use this credit to book the trip, and wasted hours and hours due to it. Booked a flight that is 2-3 months away from now to KOA (Kona airport), so I thought the ticket price would be pretty stable. We booked the flight through the Hawaiian website, used up all the credit to save up so we ended up paying $118 each (it was $418 - $300 credit). The next day, we saw the price dropped to $358 per ticket, so we contacted customer service (the call was on hold 30+ min) to either get our price matched or cancel the flight. The customer service representative said I can get $418 full refunded to my credit card, which really didn't make sense so I confirmed it multiple multiple times and the associate confirmed that that is going to be the case. After a week, I only see $118 posted on my card. Contacted them again waiting 30+min again, they said they did refund $418 to the card and asked me to contact my credit card bank to confirm the refund amount. Did that and American Express confirmed that they only see $118 from Hawaiian. Called Hawaiian again, holding 30+ min again, and finally, they transferred to the supervisor (which took another 30+ min). Finally, the supervisor says they cannot do a full refund since $300 was charged by travel credit, and they can re-send the travel credit via email. I complained about my wasted time and also told him to please educate the customer service associate about this non-refundable travel credit information so people like me don't have to waste their precious time, and the supervisor just hung up on me without any answer! I don't know when or whether I'll be receiving my credit, and I really don't want to call them again for the credit not received yet, but I may have to.

1302,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""HAL got us where we needed - eventually""","We had booked a multi-leg trip through Delta that used ""Partner"" Hawaiian Airlines (HAL) between islands. For their part, HAL got us where we needed - eventually...but not without a lot of wasted vacation time and unnecessary anxiety. 1) An hour before check-in for the next day's flight to Kona we get a text from HAL that our flight was cancelled. Okay, cutting slack for COVID or whatever reason (none was given) we were still worried about how to continue the next leg of our trip. We had no place to stay if we couldn't travel, and expensive reservations waiting the next day. They gave us a Toll-Free number to ""call"", after hours of trying, all we got was busy signal and we never got through. There was no way to rebook on HAL website, since ticketing was through Delta. So, spending 4 hours on hold getting through to Delta we rebooked for a later HAL flight - but had to pay fare difference, even though it wasn't our fault we had to make a flight change. 2) Arriving at the airport, HAL was a mess. Although our reservation included checked bags, they insisted we had to pay because, ""we're not Delta Airlines."" I get that, but we paid Delta - who already paid HAL for our seats and baggage. 3) Finally getting on the plane, there were a ton of open seats. My guess is the earlier cancellation wasn't COVID related, just saving expense to consolidate flights. We were in Economy seats and after boarding, all Exit Rows were open. On any other airline, we've been allowed to move to open seats, but not on HAL. At first, the flight attendant said we couldn't sit there because of Exit Row requirements. I responded, ""as long as we meet Exit Row requirements, why can't we sit there?"" His response, ""more money."" I get it, they market them as Premium seating. After cancelled flights, additional charges and vacation time lost, the least HAL could have done was let us sit there. The Customer Service value would cost them nothing. No. Who sat there instead? Uniformed HAL employees, probably being repositioned. I'm not begrudging that staff deserves to be treated well, but aren't we the paying customers? Through everything it seemed the message HAL was sending was, we don't need you - you need us - so live with it. Easy fix - Obviously, HAL had our cell numbers, because they texted us that the flight was cancelled, due to low occupancy. It would have been easier for them to simply put us on another flight and tell us of the time change. Better yet, since there were only about 30 people booked, they could have called us.

I showed the agent the emails I had received stating that all members of our family had been confirmed for the flight with American Airlines (through Iberia). We had flown to Boston from Indianapolis so I was able to show the Iberia agent our luggage tags for all five of our family members showing that we had confirmed flights for everyone from Indy to Barcelona with a layover in Boston. The agent searched and again said that she didn't have any record of our daughter being confirmed for the flight to Barcelona and was told that we needed to go to the American Airlines counter to discuss. We had already spent about 45 minutes with the Iberia agent at this point. The check-in counter for American was 1 mile from the Iberia counter and there were no shuttles available at that time to take us to the other terminal. All five family members ran from Iberia to AA (15 minutes) only to find out that there were no agents at the AA counter. It was now about 1.5 hours before our flight was to leave. So we ran back to the Iberia counter and told them there was nobody at the AA counter. I asked them to look again to see why they weren't seeing my daughter's boarding pass and how would it be possible for us to have all of our luggage for all five passengers from Indy to Barcelona approved on the initial check-in if we all did not have boarding passes. I asked if they could check to see if there was room on the flight to add my daughter because at that point I was desperate to get her on the flight and was willing to pay the money to make that happen. The agent said that ""Yes, there is room on the flight"" but that we need to book the flight with American.

Went to the airport the next day, Iberia’s counter was nowhere to be found, no employee available, nothing, just a ghost airline! The next day I call customer service and they could not help because their system was down, I proceed to explain my ordeal and worries about this flawed system and she replies - “I don’t control what happens at the airport and then cut off the call and sent me to a survey. Second CS call - She had said to call customer service back in 2 hours. I called customer service in 3 hours and the agent located the luggage in Madrid. I asked her to open a formal claim for my luggage, she said she couldn’t do that through her system. I exclaimed - “Then what are my options? I couldn’t do it at the airport, and I can’t do it now either.” She recommended for me to go to their website and fill out my complaint. Third CS call - I explained that I’d like to know if my luggage was in transit, the CS guy asked me for the reference number, and I explained that this airline is not like a normal one that would issue one at the airport. He assured me the luggage was in transit but without that PIR (reference number) they would not deliver it to my house, and I’d have to get it from the airport myself.

Said I was willing to pay an up-charge, would like to stay with them, and was apologetic. Was told absolutely nothing could be done, per the policy. When asked if there was anyone else I might be able to speak to, I was said I could call back and hear the same response if I liked. I did that. The next agent told me there was no option, but that if I bought another ticket ($400), he'd be happy to help me speak with a refund team about getting back an airline tax. Would not tell me an amount but said it was negligible, and when I asked if he could find out, he said the refund team doesn't have a phone number and wouldn't engage until I paid up. Asked where I could submit a complaint and that was that. My complaint was this: by helping out a customer who made a mistake once, they would keep my business and very likely get the added bonus of another customer paying for the seat I gave up. As it stands, they get the certainty of losing my business and my family's business for good. While this exact situation is on me, and hasn't arisen with any other airline, I've received excellent conflict resolutions from other companies (thank you KLM, Lufthansa and Japan Air).

I agree, that I paid for the cheapest class, but did not realize they are a Low-Cost airline (price comparable to other legacy airlines). There is no complimentary food on the flight, even though it is a transatlantic flight. Our group (2 people) was not seated next to each other (which even SPIRIT airlines do) and the only way to change that - even during check in process is - if you pay for a seat change. When we boarded the plane, there were a plenty of free seats, so my belief is that it is only for taking money out of your pocket for inconveniencing you. Our first leg of journey was delayed, and hence we would not make the transfer. When calling the airline help desk - they said : ""Just board the first flight and you will see what happens in Keflavik, we can't rebook you"". After an hour from the call, the second leg was thankfully rebooked In flight-entertainment was poorer than competition (no games, not many movies with subtitles, flight show could not be panned / interactive) even had to pay to get your set of ""airline quality"" headset. The crew was nice, airplanes were new and clean, boarding was fairly fast, since it is a smaller plane. I had the impression that their model of ""transatlantic hub in the middle of the route"" would work better and they would offer a better quality of service to make up for the layover (compared to many direct Europe - US flights), but after flying with them I do not see why I should choose their option again.

The next morning I check again and zero emails or text which was given to Icelandair. I try to check using chat after once again a very long wait time. Finally used google search and found out the flight time is now 4pm ex SEATAC. Residing in Canada we left without breakfast or even a shower to make the drive and park the car at SEATAC. The employee was more focused on my carry-on than checking for a connecting flight, I told her this carry-on meets regulations and has been used for 10 years with many airline carriers, I gave her the luggage. She was of no assistance to make sure we make the connection as with this earlier departure our wait time would be almost 11 hours in Iceland for a 2 hour flight. There was zero snack for over a 6 hour flight ... not even a cracker!

Our tour group was to leave Reykjavik at 9:00 for the Magma Hotel, 880 Kirkjubaejarklaustur, Iceland to see the northern lights. It was only because of another problem that we were delayed at the Grandi Hotel in Reykjavik that we received our bags. When I spoke with an agent at Icelandair baggage, I was told that if I didn't wait, Icelandair would NOT pay the expense to drive our bags to our next hotel. I find that irresponsible and in-excusable for customer service. Icelandair lost our bags and should have readily driven our bags to where ever we were staying in the country. On our return trip to the USA we were delayed due to a storm. We would have to stay in NYC and catch the next JetBlue flight the next morning. We paid for our bags to be checked through to San Francisco but found, the next morning, that Jet Blue demanded payment for baggage again from NYC to SFO. Icelandair was to put us up at a hotel in New York City for the night.

I’ve always had a good experience, until recently. I am so incredibly disappointed in the poor customer service my boyfriend and I have received recently. I booked a trip to Europe to visit friends and naturally, I booked with Icelandair. My boyfriend decided he wanted to fly out to join us a few days into my trip. Per my recommendation, we booked him with Icelandair. During the time of booking, there was no travel restrictions for American tourists traveling to the Netherlands (our destination). For layovers in the KEF airport, it was required for American tourists to provide a negative COVID test OR a proof of vaccination. My boyfriend was scheduled to depart our local airport on September 5th. On September 4th the travel restrictions were altered and suddenly both a negative test and proof of vaccination was required. When my boyfriend arrived at the airport, he was denied boarding onto his plane. He is not vaccinated, but was able to provide the negative test. This was no longer sufficient. This caused numerous issues and loss of funds for both of us, throughout my entire trip. When we contacted customer service regarding the refund, we were told that he would not be issued one! I am just besides myself at the unwillingness to help us due to the circumstances. This is completely ridiculous. Not only was this of no fault of ours, we also purchased the Travel Protection Plan! We were still told that he has been listed as a “No Show” and our situation doesn’t fit into the policy for any of the refund guidelines. I understand that times are strange, and restrictions change almost daily (why we purchased the protection plan).

We are being forced to pay for a series of flights that were never taken, refused a refund for the because of what? The airline wasn’t inconvenienced at all.

1390,Interjet,2,"""not wanting to be more flexible""","I have made several attempts to speak with someone but all attempts have failed. Finally today, April 25, 2020 I was able to speak with an agent from Expedia. Unfortunately after spending over an hour with her and then escalating to a supervisor there was still no consideration for the current circumstances. On I purchased two airline tickets for my daughter and son in law. Flight 3971 was to depart on 05/15/2020 at 2:55pm from Dallas arriving in Mexico City (Flight 2466) at 5:35, leaving at 7:50pm to our final destination Puerto Vallarta arriving at 9:15. Their returning flight 2463 was scheduled to leave Puerto Vallarta on 05/19/2020 at 1:10pm, arriving in Mexico City at 2:45. Leaving Mexico City on flight 3972 at 6:35pm arriving back in Dallas at 9:15pm. I must add that I purchased insurance for these tickets however cannot speak with anyone with that group neither. As we are all aware due to the Covid-19 situation there are things that are out of everyone’s control. On Friday, April 24, 2020 Expedia-Interjet emailed me to advise that they were changing the details to the original flight dates. They gave us no choices besides 1 and it was take it or leave it. Please note not only were the times of the flights changed which is no biggie but the dates are way off in comparison to our original dates WE purchased. Please note that my daughter and son in law needed to return specifically on May 19, 2020 as they have 2 small children and can not be away from them additional days aside the 4 originally planned. Interjet is now wanting them to return 2 days later with no other options. The return date is not an option. I called Expedia today and they advised that they are not able to issue a refund. I then asked for a credit and they were willing to do so. However they want to issue the credit in my daughter and son in laws name. I explained that I paid for the tickets and wanted the credit in my name as I travel more. Bottom line that I paid for them and they are able to see this. The supervisor from Expedia then called Interjet and asked for an exception. Reminder that Interject changed my plans, not me. The manager at Interjet said that they could not issue a refund but he would be willing to issues the credits in my name for a fee of $118.00 each ticket. Yes that’s right! Interjet will not give me a refund for a flight they changed. Interjet will however give me credit for an additional fee even though they initiated the change. I believe my request is reasonable. I’d like a refund but if it’s not an option why not give the person credit who paid for the tickets. The supervisor recommended that I do a chargeback with my bank however this is not a fraudulent situation nor am I disputing the charge. I’m asking for the 2 credits to be issued in my name as my daughter and son in law will not be able to travel those dates nor use a voucher in the next 12 months. It’s so hard to wrap my mind around the thought of the airline not wanting to be more flexible in times like this. Our condo was canceled and most business are closed in Puerto Vallarta.

My first experience was trying to pay for seat selections and checked baggage. Their website forwards to Alitalia, so unless the website language is set to Italian, the transaction does not go through. During one attempt, I was charged to my credit card, despite the transaction on their website showing an error for “time out”. It took about three hours to figure out how to pay for seat selections and checked bags. When it came time to check in, I noticed that my seat selection I had paid USD 75 was not applied to my ticket, so called the help desk. After waiting on hold for what felt like an eternity, I was told there was nothing they could do, as the plane was full, so to email their complaints team for a refund. I did that over a week ago now and have received no response, so just filed a dispute with my credit card. I then found out that the airline doesn’t participate in TSA Pre-Check, so had to wait over an hour at security even though I have Global Entry (which includes TSA Pre-Check) for the specific reason of avoiding long security queues. Once boarded, I intended to use the WiFi do work for business purposes in order to not fall behind, but soon discovered the WiFi was not functioning and did not function throughout the entirety of the flight. Meals were small and insufficient in frequency. We were served two small meals once the course of the 12-hour flight. Snacks were kept at the rear of the plane, and given how many passengers frequented the snack bar, it would seem many people agreed with my sentiments.

Well everyone else on that plane that ordered a special meal still got many snacks and ice cream. The “special “ meal was absolutely disgusting. I wouldn’t have given it to an animal. It was not distinguishable in any way and they gave her fish with cheese sauce as the “bland meal” along with raw onion and pepper salad.

JAL staff in Seattle weren't particularly friendly, but JAL staff at Narita were quite pleasant and helpful in my brief interactions with them. The quality of the meal and drinks were quite satisfactory for economy class. They had a decent selection of entertainment from around the world, including some Japanese movies that I ended up watching with English subtitles. The plane and lavatories were clean; the on-flight personnel, the utmost in being pleasant and professional. One flight attendant in particular, Cindy from Singapore, chatted with me about Singapore for a minute and wished me safe and enjoyable travels to that city. Something else: I got up and went to the toilet, and came back only to find my neck pillow missing (I'm convinced that some passenger stole it. Who does that, steal a nondescript black neck pillow?!) At any rate, I disembarked the plane after landing at Narita; right before walking out of the jetway, I still wanted to try to at least make one more effort to find that neck pillow. I explained to the flight staff that I was looking for a pillow, and it had gone missing. 5-6 flight attendants sprung into action, with me, to look for that pillow. While it was never found, I made sure to smile and say ""Thank you!"" I have a hard time imagining that that level of service would ever occur on a North American airline.

1442,Japan Airlines,1,"""all of the food was truly superb""","Boston to Manila via Tokyo-Narita. The flight from Boston to Tokyo was on a B787-9, and the flight from Tokyo to Manila was on a B787-8. The flight from Boston to Tokyo was scheduled to depart in the middle of a blizzard. Unfortunately, this created some problems regarding preparing the aircraft. We eventually boarded (very quickly, as is Japan Airlines' custom). We then had to wait for a while as our plane was de-iced. We ended up leaving Boston about two hours late. However, the pilots were able to make up for one of those hours in the air, so that we only arrived about one hour late in Tokyo. Another passenger was concerned about making his connecting flight in Tokyo. A flight attendant calmly explained that he would have enough time and that they would hold the flight for him if necessary. This turned out to be unnecessary, as, to my shock, the staff at Narita basically just allowed all arriving passengers with connecting international flights to go directly into the gate area without first clearing security. This was truly a godsend and ensured that people really did make their connecting flights. And since gates weren't supposed to close until just 10 minutes before departure, this meant they did not even have to hold planes for people! As for the inflight experience, it was similar to my experiences from Manila to Boston, except that there was no last-minute snack service just before arriving in Tokyo. Instead, they offered us sweet buns midway through the flight. Again, we were served a full meal on the flight from Boston to Tokyo and on the flight from Tokyo to Manila, as well as a light meal towards the end of the flight from Boston to Tokyo. And once again, with the exception of the full meal from Boston to Tokyo, there were no choices for the meals-there was only one option. However, as usual, all of the food was truly superb. Because I was flying during a different month from my previous flights with Japan Airlines, I noticed they removed from their entertainment system a movie I had begun watching previously and had hoped to finish watching during this trip. That was disappointing. There were toothbrushes and toothpaste available in the lavatories during the flight from Boston to Tokyo, but not until relatively late in the flight.

1446,Japan Airlines,1,"""requested a full refund""","Seattle to Tokyo . We purchased an air ticket for my wife to travel to visit family in Tokyo, Japan, on JAL. The ticket was purchased via GoToGate travel - purchased on 4/3/2019 for travel beginning on 6/25/2019 at a cost of approximately $1200. Unfortunately, after booking and upon inspection of her travel document, she discovered a typographical error in her first name. On the ticket, her first name (four letters) has an extra letter (ii instead of i) rather than the correct spelling. We're not sure how this happened, and were quite surprised to see it. We made repeated attempts to rectify this situation and get the typo corrected. We contacted GoToGate by phone and email multiple times. We contacted JAL by phone and email multiple times. We drove to the airport in San Diego and asked for help at the JAL desk. We contacted Alaska Air. Though our efforts did receive some replies, none were satisfactory. The typo remains on the ticket. Given the fact that TSA or the Airline may stop her at Airport Security Screening, or stop her from boarding the flight, she is not willing to use the ticket. Therefore, we have requested a full refund for the amount of the ticket, minus an appropriate handling fee, so that her booking via Go To Gate on Alaska and JAL will available, and so that some other passenger may book travel on the seat. We believe that the airline and the travel agency have a moral obligation and responsibility to serve customers to the best of their abilities, and to rectify this kind of situation. Moreover, both the airline, the travel agency, and other customers stand to benefit by allowing the seat to be used by another customer.

My flight was through 02 transits each for the arrival and return trip, and most of the flights which were run in cooperation between JAL and American Airlines had at least 30 min delay but I was fine about that. However, in my second flight upon return after the first transit, JAL was late for 1 hour and 20 mins due to maintenance issue, whilst my connecting flight (the final one to return home) is only 1 hour from the previous flight's arrival time. When we got to NRT, the connecting flight has not yet departed, and was still boarding, but instead of guiding us to the gate so that we can be on board quickly (which may take approx. 10 mins), they threw us to another airline, with an additional transit (KL) and additional 10 hours flight and waiting at the KL airport. What is even more frustrating is the JAL staff who gave us the new ticket, she said in the first place when we just arrived, running and confused: JAL arranged another flight by which we can get home at midnight on the same day ?. Only when we recheck our tickets it appears that we have to wait 5 hours at KL and arrive at 10:00AM the next day. (The group that were left from the final flight was about 6 people). When we asked about our luggage, she said that our luggage is already transferred to the final destination and we don't have to worry about them  - should we not worry if the luggage arrive before us? Later, I checked with another girl at the counter, she said that our luggage are coming with us on this flight, and it is the airlines rule that the luggage must fly together with the passenger. Everything happened today was such a disappointment and created a bad impression to me about JAL. We waited for them to be late for 01 hr and 20 min, whilst they cannot wait for us just a few minutes so we can get to the gate and come home after 14 flight hours, just to be on time on THAT flight, as if they are very punctual and never delay..

I picked the Japanese menu but also expressed that I liked caviar, which belonged to the Western menu, and the attendant happily obliged. She also offered to make my bed in the suite across the aisle (the cabin was only half full) so I can continue to use my suite for lounging and the other for sleeping. Such small initiatives made a difference between good and excellent service.

Our flight was supposed to be about 2 1/2 hours from Seattle to LAX. After arriving at our gate we learned that our flight had been delayed by 2 hours. Ok, no big deal. Then another 2 hours, and then again and again. Our flight was delayed for more than 10 hours. After speaking to the gate agent 2 different times, we, and everyone else were told the plane had a mechanical issue and would arrive asap. Everyone was also told they would be issued a $200 credit for the delay per Jet Blue policy. The gate agent said we would receive an email regarding this credit. Nobody was happy about the delay, but at least we would be compensated, or so we thought. After several days without an email about the credit we were promised I called Jet Blue customer service. I was told that we were not entitled to any compensation because our 10 hour delay was weather related. How convenient. Their compensation policy doesn't cover weather delays. I already knew weather delays weren't covered after reading their policy during our delay. I asked where the plane was coming from and they said LAX. What weather delays does LAX have in July? I explained to them that a result of this delay my family lost an entire day of our vacation and lost our car rental since we arrived after hours. Why do Jet Blue gate agents tell us all it was a mechanical issue with the plane (covered under their compensation policy) and promise everyone compensation, then Jet Blue doesn't follow through? Sounds like a bait and switch. Customer service offered us a $75 credit to each of us as a ""courtesy"". I declined the credit because this isn't about a dollar amount for me. This is about a company following through with what it promises its customers. After sharing this story with a friend, they explained that they had a similar experience with Jet Blue.

1469,Jetblue Airways,2,"""misguided by the JetBlue agent""","I bought a JetBlue return ticket with 50 lbs of check-in baggage to travel from Atlanta and Boston from June 05 to June 10, 2023. I faced three main problems: 1) After a few days of booking, I was informed by JetBlue that my direct flight had been canceled. They also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from Boston. I contacted the JetBlue helpline and requested to book another flight (the only option for June 10), which wasn’t direct (rather Boston to Florida to Atlanta). 2) During the online boarding process on June 05 and 10, I had to choose a check-in baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if I had already paid for check-in baggage. I followed the same process on my return flight from Boston to Atlanta. But my credit card was charged $35 for my Atlanta to Boston trip. After a few days, when I looked at my credit card summary, I contacted JetBlue for a refund. They said they would process my request in the next ten days. But contacting JetBlue support was a very frustrating process: wait time was 45 minutes, and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a JetBlue crewmember. 3) The most important and frustrating thing I experienced on June 10 when returning from Boston to Atlanta. The good thing was that JetBlue informed me that I must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in Boston City; therefore, commuting to Boston airport may take longer than usual. My flight was scheduled for 3:45 PM. Therefore, I left for the airport at 12:00 PM. But when I reached the airport, I learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes. The flight kept on delaying, and finally, I learned that I would not be able to catch my 2nd JetBlue flight from Florida to Atlanta if I flew by the original flight from Boston to Florida. I approached the JetBlue helpdesk at Boston Airport. After more than 90 minutes of waiting, I talked to the help desk official. He issued me a new direct ticket (Boston to Atlanta) for the next day. Upon asking, they informed me that I could book a hotel for up to $250. I booked a hotel for an overnight stay in Boston and spent around $240 (I didn’t eat dinner). Then I contacted JetBlue and sent them the invoice. After ten days, I was informed by JetBlue that I was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather. Why was I misguided by the JetBlue agent that I was entitled to a $250 hotel?

1476,Jetblue Airways,2,"""experiences left much to be desired""","I recently had the opportunity to fly with JetBlue airlines on two separate occasions, and my experiences left much to be desired. While I appreciate that delays can happen, the level of inconvenience I faced on both my outbound and return flights was simply unacceptable. During my initial journey, my flight was delayed for four hours, causing significant disruption to my travel plans. This unexpected delay left me frustrated and feeling as though my time was not valued by the airline. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but the lack of clear communication and assistance from the JetBlue staff compounded my disappointment. However, my dissatisfaction reached new heights when my return flight was delayed for five hours. The reason provided for this prolonged delay was particularly disheartening: the pilot was allegedly stuck in traffic. It is perplexing to think that such a vital member of the flight crew would not have contingencies in place to avoid traffic-related mishaps. This incident gave rise to concerns about the airline's organizational preparedness and overall professionalism. While I acknowledge that flight delays can occur across the industry, the recurrence of such extensive delays with JetBlue has left a lasting impression. The overall lack of transparency and efficiency in handling these situations left me questioning the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I must mention, however, that once the flights finally took off, the onboard experience was pleasant. The flight attendants were courteous and attentive, and the in-flight amenities provided a comfortable journey. However, these positive aspects were overshadowed by the significant inconveniences and frustrations I encountered at the start of both trips. In conclusion, my experiences with JetBlue airlines left me disappointed and hesitant to choose their services in the future. While the onboard experience was commendable, the recurring and excessively long delays I faced at the beginning of my trips, including a delay of five hours due to a pilot stuck in traffic, greatly overshadowed any positive aspects.

1484,Jetblue Airways,1,"""later deny us a refund""","My wife and I arrived at the airport 90 minutes in advance, and the flight was delayed 30 minutes, so we ended up 2 hours early. The lines for baggage drop-off were out the door. We used a JetBlue kiosk to purchase two bag tags to check two of our bags; it charged us for two but only printed out one. We were told by a JetBlue employee to go to the kiosk help desk line to address the issue: there were two snaking lines of maybe 20-30 people each, manned by just two employees, and they were moving at the rate of one customer every 10-15 minutes. Were we to wait in that line, we almost certainly were going to miss our flight. So, we elected to use a second kiosk to purchase a bag tag for our second bag in the hopes this one would work; it didn't, but it took our money (again). So, rather than jump from kiosk to kiosk, paying more and more money in the hope that one would work, which is unreasonable, we were forced to wait in line. By the time we reached the front, the JetBlue employee told us that we were going to miss our flight and that, in addition, the flight was ""overbooked,"" so they were going to have to ""rebook"" or ""cancel."" She searched for other flights that day, including through JetBlue, its partner American Airlines, and non-partner airlines; the earliest available flight was July 1. It was the morning of June 28, we had just moved out of our apartment and shipped our stuff to LA, and we were scheduled to move into our new LA apartment that same day, so we would have had to pay for food and lodging for the interval period in Boston--a hefty price--rather than stay in our new paid-for apartment in LA. We explained this to the JetBlue employee, who said that she would cancel our flight and issue a refund for our tickets and bags. I requested confirmation that this would be to our original payment method; she confirmed it would be. There was only one more flight in the entire Boston region that had capacity to take us to LA before July 1: a flight leaving in two hours out of Providence. My wife and I booked the flight, quickly compared taxi and rideshare prices, discovered the difference was negligible, and took an Uber to the airport in Providence, where we successfully boarded the last flight to LA. We later discovered that we had been deceived by the JetBlue employee at the kiosk help desk in Boston; she did NOT issue any refund and instead wrote in her ""notes"" that my wife and I were ""late"" to check in our bags, which was a complete lie and clearly intended to create a fabricated, falsified paper trail to later deny us a refund. We could not check in our bags because JETBLUE'S kiosks were defective, but that didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives. The fact that we were told the flight was overbooked even though it apparently wasn't didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives.

They are apparently now among the list of worst airlines for cancellations and delays. Not only was our initial flight from SLC to FLL (and then to PUJ) delayed 4 times, it was finally cancelled, for something not only under their control, but something they would have known about for hours and didn't let the passengers know until about 3 in the morning (their phone support even attempted to say it was due to weather, but there were no weather issues in SLC or JFK where the flight crew was coming from, and we even verified that with the airline). Which means we missed our connecting flight. Then they rebooked us taking a completely different route to our final destination (JFK instead of FLL), which was then delayed and delayed and delayed, making the connecting flight a problem once again. We spend HOURS and HOURS on support with them, trying to get everything situated. We missed out on about $1000 in resort time that we had paid for, not including our time, gas, and other things we had to pay for. And JetBlue's response? Too bad, so sad. They took zero responsibility, and very rudely said they wouldn't do anything for us, even after being very calm with them. Pathetic airline.

I tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working. It is not required beforehand and this was from an official immigration officer at Barbados) I'm not angry at the people at the boarding desk because I do understand they were doing their job but they refused to let me board the plane until I had this particular document which I could not get at all because the site is not working. A nice manager walked out and had to get on a computer for 20 minutes and by so miracle got it handled so I could board the plane. I was livid and so upset that I was not going to be allowed to board my plane over something that is not even necessary! Truly the immigration officer at Barbados thought the whole thing was ridiculous and everyone else on the plane (coming from the US) was able to fill out their form at customs. They thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the San Jose Airport/Jet Blue demanded I have that and almost denied me getting on that plane. The first plane ride was 4 hours and a red eye and absolute hell. They kept the lights on the entire time, and the flight attendants kept coming up and down the aisle hitting me with elbow/tray at least 20 times. They were angry. 40 minutes before landing they start screaming at everyone to wake up and the person next to me in the middle seat had her seat back and was sound asleep with her hood over her eyes. A flight attendant walked up and stood over me to forcibly yank her seat back, yank her hood off and tell her to""wake up. They then just glared at me to remove the bag off my lap while we still had 30 minutes to land. On my next flight to Barbados, no one asked for this stupid entry form when I was boarding which I thought was super comical. I was in a middle seat and when I sat down there was stuff in the aisle seat but no one around. Flight attendants kept asking me over and over whose stuff it was and I'm like don't know. Finally a sweet older lady comes up with a cane and says everybody calm down, I was at the back of the plane allowing everyone to come though because it's really hard for me to get up and down (come to find out the poor lady had a knee injury). Flight attendants were so rude to her. I had been flying for over 12 hours and was extremely thirsty and kept getting such attitude when I asked for water.

1537,Kenya Airways,1,"""vow to never fly KA again""","This review is regarding Kenya Airways customer service and has nothing to do with the details of a specific flight. Our return to Chicago was cancelled when the KA pilots went on strike. My family of four was left to arrange alternate flight arrangements by ourselves and our travel agent who was back in Chicago. We absolutely received no help from anyone at KA. Finally got economy class tickets with Turkish Air which we took from Nairobi to Istanbul and home to Chicago. Had to pay for those tickets and was told to wait for a refund of the return with KA for our cancelled business class tickets. As it turned out, we had to wait a while for our refund which finally arrived on Feb 27. The refund was issued for almost $1200 each ($4800 for the four of us). While this may sound fair, please consider that we paid a total of $14,647 for our four business class round trip tickets to Nairobi and back. Additionally, we had to pay for our return via Turkish Air at a total of $6356. So the refund represented less than 1/3rd of the cost of the original round trip tickets. We were hoping for some consideration of the cost we incurred with Turkish Air, which ultimately was caused by KA. Following a recommendation from the CEO of KA I was contacted by one of his subordinates. While, I do believe that this individual may have had some impact upon the processing of the refund, I disagreed with him on numerous occasions when he and his staff tried to explain the refund policy to me following disruptions in service. The following is a direct quote from his email to regarding these situations: “In the event of disruptions such as the strike, the airline makes arrangements to carry you at the earliest opportunity on one of our scheduled services or reroute you to the destination shown on the ticket by our own services or those of another carrier at no additional cost to you. Should the alternative flights not be suitable or we are unable to rebook you to an alternate flight, you are entitled to a refund of the value of the unused portion of your tickets.” I contended to him that neither myself nor any member of my family was approached by anyone from KA to reroute us OR that anybody at the KA desk was willing to assist us make alternate flight arrangements. I was particularly incensed when I read the words in red, stating “…at no additional cost to you.” I feel lied to and disrespected by Kenya Airways in their addressing our significant and inconvenient disruption of service. I have found examples of other travelers on our flight similarly affected by the strike who had desk clerks reroute them with no additional out of pocket expenditure.

I had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 minutes online - and was even free as it was a “Business Light” ticket. All flights were on time. Checked in online. Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying, the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways (KQ) uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous, proactive attendants. No champagne, but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy, fast, not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat – what a pleasure. Onboard, welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered, reclining, new, and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out, but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My pre-ordered special sea food meals were all different, delicious, and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra, but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs, all Kenyans, were good and caring – though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours’ layover. The last stretch to Kigali was with IFE onboard, champagne, and my beloved seafood hot meal, which KQ still offers (even in economy) in contrast to Qatar and Emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as “dietary reasons” to order.

1540,Kenya Airways,3,"""charge-back process to recover this fee""","We flew from JFK to NBO just before the pandemic was declared. This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. It seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and had a smile on their faces, something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet. Check in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process. The plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals. The biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed. If I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating. Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue. However, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had).

1542,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,3,"""I do expect better than this""","We were flying from Washington, D.C. to Cardiff in the UK.  The trouble began when we were about to board a connecting flight at JFK in New York City: the flight from Amsterdam to Cardiff was cancelled literally 30 minutes before we boarded the flight out to Amsterdam. We were held at the gate while they rebooked everything, and we nearly missed our flight. The flight to Amsterdam was rough: we wanted to sleep, but there were very loud passengers behind us, and they wouldn't be quiet for a minute. Once in Amsterdam, we were routed to Edinburgh in Scotland, then flown to Cardiff on Loganair. We were told we might have additional baggage fees, but we lucked out and this didn't happen. We got to Cardiff about five hours late, and we were exhausted by then. We had to fly back on KLM, and the fun started again. The plane was held up on the tarmac in Cardiff after they realized the plane was leaking deicer fluid from the wings, and we sat there in a hot plane for about 90 minutes while a technician tried to fix it. At one point, they announced the plane would not be able to fly. However, they were able to fix it somehow, so we weren't forced to get rebooked for another flight and spend hours waiting around Cardiff. The flight from Amsterdam to Dulles in D.C. was relatively harmless, although I found the flight attendant we had rather rude. She lectured me at one point because I had put some trash in a plastic water bottle. Finally, we made it back to D.C. and through passport control. And we started waiting for our luggage on the carousel, and we waited and waited for one large bag, because, as it turned out, it had been left behind in Amsterdam. So, we had to file a claim and wait two more days until our bag finally showed up. My wife was taking another trip and only had a day to do laundry afterward. I wasn't impressed overall.

On one single trip, we were rebooked 5 times on inward and outward flights and only after writing angry messages were we offered a normal alternative to a new flight that included two 6 hours layovers, which was supposed to have none. No food vouchers offered, you have to force them to do everything and therefore force you to become an annoying passenger for the unfortunate ground personell. Last but not least, our last flight was delayed by two hours and the only offered option instead of our actual transfer flight was to stay at the airport for 10 hours, again no offers of food or lounge without going to the counter and waiting in line for an hour. What took the crown was that our automatically rebooked flights and human rebooked flights were all still in the system with no tickets reissued. That meant that we were unable to check in, unable to reserve seats, unable to get the seats we payed for and altogether made it impossible for the lady at the counter to understand what was going on without calling KLM directly.

When I arrived to the check in gate in Houston I was told that I had been downgraded from Premium Comfort to Economy because of a change in aircraft and that my baggage allowance had changed. I had packed my bags the night before and then woken up early to drive 3 hours to Houston to catch the flight. Needless to say, I wasn't willing to throw any of my luggage in the trash. I told them there wasn't any way that I would have had time to re-pack my bags (now noticing that I had received an email at 3 am notifying me of the downgrade.) After much discussion I was finally permitted to take all my luggage with me. The rudeness and lack of understanding at the counter was disgusting. On the plane the staff were perfectly friendly. However, somehow in the downgrade process my meal plan had been erased. I have a severe allergy but thankfully the attendant was very kind and helpful in finding me something I could eat. On the return flight I had the opposite problem - my meal plan had resurfaced but the food I'm allergic to was very present in the dish. I notified the staff that I had an allergy and was there anything else I could possibly eat? I'm not picky, I just don't particularly want to break out in hives. She very begrudgingly searched around until she found something but she wasn't happy, saying that I had requested a specific meal. I acknowledged her, and said yes I had, but the ingredients aren't listed when I select it and - I have an allergy. For the next meal she brought me the dish again, with the food I'm allergic to, and smiled when she handed it to me. Oh joy. The smile on her face made me stare at the food in disbelief in front of me. I accepted it and just didn't eat. How could she smile like that? I had submitted a request for the refund fare difference for the first flight and it was accepted but I was told that I needed to resubmit it again after all flights are finished. I guess because they can't keep track of it for a week? The service I received was atrocious. The red tape ridiculous. But they certainly know how to train their employees on board to be friendly, serving you your food allergy and all.

I had to find the solution myself and we were still unable to get our friend with us. I was told to do the reimbursement online for the downgrade. So I did and it was rejected.

We expected to pay $100 for each of our second checked bags because that's what the website says. However, we found out while checking the bags that they only allow 10kg per carry on bag.  So we ended up having to pay and extra $200 each (on top of the expected $100 each) to check our second carry-on bags since they were both over 10kg. I have never had an airline weigh my carry-ons before. We gave them our credit cards and then once they checked our bags, they told us we had to go to a different counter to pick up our cards. We went there and proceeded to wait for 45 minutes while they tried to charge our cards. There was no one waiting in front of us. It literally took them 4 staff members and 45 minutes to swipe 2 credit cards. They finally told us they would waive one of the $200 charges. We gladly accepted this and left to board.

1553,Korean Air,9,"""flight was one of the best""","Honolulu to Seoul-Incheon (proceeding to Hong Kong) in June 2019 - but I'm going to focus on the Honolulu - Seoul leg only for this review. This was my 7th flight on Korean Air - and all of this started on a very speedy, no-nonsense check-in process at Honolulu International Airport. The immigration checks were quick, and after a short bite, I went to the gate 2.5 hours before departure time. The boarding gate staffs were overall great - so does the cabin crews. I was welcomed in a friendly way. Upon reaching my seat, I figured out that my seat was comfortable in terms of legroom, with tons of features, but the seats were quite firm and hard, and there were several kid stickers that the cleaning crew had missed. Not a big deal for me. Throughout the entire flight, the crew kept on being friendly to me - they asked everything, even asking me if I have ever tried Bibimbap before - my 1st meal for the flight, which tasted very good. The 2nd meal of mine served before landing was beef with rice, which tasted good, but the meal presentation made me deny the 5-star rating. By this point, the crews were still very friendly but they couldn't hide the tiredness they had after the 9-hour journey (which is normal). The biggest blow of the flight was the IFE - hence why I didn't give this flight a 10/10.

Leg room was very good, entertainment ok although the range of movies is far more limited than Delta Studio. The crew were unfriendly and even borderline rude towards non-Korean passengers. I repeatedly observed them being very friendly and all smiles towards Korean passengers, however, the treatment towards non-Korean passengers was different. I believe this is because they felt more obliged to be courteous towards their local passengers. The biggest complaint I have though is the food. Food portions were terribly small and mostly tasteless. Halfway through the flight, I ate a sandwich which I purchased at the airport and flight attendant told me I was not allowed to eat outside food.

Weather caused our American Airlines initial flight (all booked through the Korean Air website), to be delayed multiple times causing us to miss our connecting flight to Seoul and ultimately to Bangkok. Called the Korean air service line and they suggested requesting the gate agent to ask them to hold the flight. American agents said Korean does not do that. After calling both airline service lines and having close to an hour delay, they both said the other airlines had to change it. American was adamant this is a Korean ticket and only they can release to change. BTW, 2 kids under 5 that had been up since 4 am, so we were not in the mood to run around the airport. Chicago transfer agent K20 gate, wouldn’t let us transfer, so had to go out of security to get to terminal 5. So took the bus, with whole family in tow, to terminal 5. The Korean Air agents used very polite words to say it wasn’t their problem, they would not help and the best they could do was standby for tomorrow and since the flight was full, very unlikely to go tomorrow. That was the last straw. Helping me to resolve the problem is the job of the Korean Air service counter team, when I bought tickets from their company.

We decided to spend a little bit more for our flight to Thailand in exchange for a better service and were disappointed: We could have saved several hundreds of dollars if we had used a Chinese budget airline. What was good about Korean Air were the flight attendants who were super friendly and helpful, on our return flight to LAX they even carried my carry on bag for me, when they saw that I was holding our baby. The reason why we won't fly with Korean Air anymore: I had ordered a ""vegetarian oriental meal"" (not vegan, but vegetarian which isn't as restrictive) What I received was a joke: it looked like someone had emptied half a can of peas into the aluminum container and thrown some bok choi leaves on top. No sauce, tofu, rice or potatoes. Horrible. My wife was still hungry after her meal and asked for a snack. The answer was: ""we don't carry any snacks"" (contrary to what their website says: ""Snack Service A wide variety of snacks, such as samgak kimbop, cup ramen, pizza, and makkoli rice cakes, are served on long flights."" The flight attendant explained: ""we stopped offering cup ramen because of the smell"" when my wife told him that she used to get ramen on previous flights.  I had one can of beer at the beginning of the flight and ordered a gin tonic several hours later. This drink spilled because my table was defective (the kind which you pull out from the armrest). When I asked for another drink they watered it down and advised me ""this is your last drink, each passenger is allowed to have only 3 drinks"". I was not the slightest little bit drunken and very surprised because even on low budget airlines like Air India nobody told me how many drinks I could have. This is obviously a policy which is supposed to save the airline money.  We both started to get a headache because of dehydration. When I asked for water, the flight attendant poured approximately 4 table spoons into a cup, I went back and forth several times between our seats and the pantry and each time they filled the cup only 50%. We were both thirsty during the entire flight. Before departure there was a bottle of water on each seat and as soon as the boarding was completed, they hurried to collect the water bottles from the vacant seats. (Probably in order to lock them up in the safe...) 5.) We had purchased an inflatable pillow which was specifically designed for air travel. As soon as my wife started to inflate the pillow, several flight attendants approached us saying that we were not allowed to use it.

Checkin at the airport was quick and can’t expect anything more. Boarding process can be improved, as there were no clear instructions for the lines. People were impatient and it was a mess. I was traveling JFK-Kuwait-Chennai (KU118). On time flight left the gate, probably since it’s weekend and peak hours we were taxiing for more than 30 mins. This delayed the departure quite badly.

I did not have a single flight with Kuwait, either on my way to Dubai or back that was on time. From JFK, my flight was delayed for 3 hours, causing me to miss my connection to Dubai. They put us in a Hotel on Airport property, which, although had a good view of the apron, was a sub-par hotel. The ground staff do not know how to do their job correctly. They are rude, and the airport lacks proper signage. You are bussed around from terminal to terminal with no real staff presence to guide you. We almost missed our flight to JFK because the gate was labeled Mumbai, so we didn't know that it was intended for New York. Kuwait Airport doesn't even seem qualified to be a domestic airport, lacking proper signage and two distant terminals which you're bussed around in. Ground crew does not care about you, and show no interest or courtesy when dealing with you. The same can be said with the cabin crew. They are rude, and do not know how to treat passengers. The meal timings are horrible, as they leave many passengers extremely hungry for long hours on the plane, and water service is extremely selective. You'd think an airline knows when to give out water and food. They also gave us no details about our stop in Shannon on our way back to JFK and could not be seen for much of the flight. The only good part about the flight was the legroom, which was spacious. However, that is not a reason for booing Kuwait over any other competent airline.

I was unsure what to expect. The check-in was a breeze at JFK and the agent said it was a light flight with about 35-40% load factor. That was surprising being just a day before Eid. Boarding was easy, and the aircraft pushed back 15 min before schedule. JFK-KWI flight, the aircraft very clean and seats comfortable. Legroom was fantastic. I managed to get a window seat and had all the three seats to myself. Rather almost everyone in the aft cabin had 3 seats to themselves. Individual TV screen was very responsive with a decent collection of programming. The crew was friendly and courteous. Menus, blanket, and basic amenity pouch handed out. Food was ok but can improve in quality. Was concerned about the short 45 min connection in Kuwait, but the flight arrived about an hour early. Kuwait airport is medieval and dirty with a few coffees and duty-free shops. Security checks are not centralized but occur at each gate leading to long lines and delays. My KWI-DXB flight (B 777-300 ER) was packed and was delayed more than an hour due to long lines at gate security. The short flight was uneventful and were handed out in a takeaway Iftar meal boxes. So, an in all a rather good flight. Return leg: DXB-KWI (A320) was short and uneventful with breakfast boxes handed out. KWI-JFK via Shannon was painful with an 85% load. Long security lines at the gate in Kuwait. One of the Kuwaiti pax who I chatted with was like - this flight is always delayed. Multiple security checks and verifications. Lotta connecting passengers mostly from South Asia and some of them didn’t know the flight had a stopover at Shannon. Lunch served, and amenity kits handed out. My choice of meal had run out but was nothing great. All pax deplaned at Shannon to go through multiple hellish security points and get back in about 2 hrs. It just gave time to stretch and use the toilets. Cabin crew was cheerful and courteous but I asked for blankets and was told none remain, however at the time of deplaning at JFK found an open overhead bin full of blankets.

1586,LATAM Airlines,1,"""expected to pay for the airline's errors""","LATAM is unable to provide adequate support when it comes to flight changes or issues which leaves customers to fend for themselves or fork over a ton of cash to fix LATAM's problem. I do not recommend flying with LATAM if you will have multiple connections or if you're booking out far enough in advance that flight times, etc. might change because it will be nearly impossible to get your itinerary corrected. I purchased my flights directly through LATAM from SAN to LAX to SCL. When it came time to check in for my flight (18 hours before take off) I was unable to check in for my flight; it was impossible via the app and online. I called the LATAM support line and they were able to confirm that the error was an internal booking error (i.e. 100% LATAM's fault) which resulted in me not actually having a seat on the first flight. None of the four reps that I talked to (over four hours) could change the ticket or help me out. They told me that my options were to: 1) Cancel my ticket and be refunded, 2) I could pay to 'change' my flights, or 3) they could open a case and someone would call me eventually. A case was opened, however no one called me within the next 12 hours (at which point my flight was 6 hours from takeoff). I called them again (two hours this time) and confirmed with them what my options were and they confirmed that one of them was cancelling the ticket for a refund, so I told them that I wanted to get a refund for my ticket. Suddenly, this was no longer an option and the person couldn't explain why and also couldn't do anything else. The advice that the rep gave me was to ""be patient"" which I find unacceptable. They said I could 'try going to the connecting airport and check in there to see what happens,"" although they separately indicated that if I 'missed' my first flight then the entire trip would be cancelled. About an hour before my first flight was scheduled to take off, I got an email that said ""we tried to reach you"" to address the case however I had no missed calls and it had no instructions to get in touch with them again. I never received a follow up. Even if they had called, it would have been too late to make it to the airport for my flight on time (even if I was standing in the airport lobby when I answered the call) which is unacceptable. I gave LATAM $1200 for a ticket and only gave me headaches and stress.  Their customer service team is not able to fix even basic issues and the customer is expected to pay for the airline's errors. Customer service reps also feel free to hang up on you which happened to me at least three times. I ended up having to buy a whole new ticket for my trip which was almost 2x my original price since, as you can imagine, buying an international flight on the day of the trip isn't going to be cheaper than the original. LATAM's flight schedule changes (a whole other issue that I didn't discuss here, but which cost me and my six travel buddies each 6+ hours on the phone with LATAM) and their other errors cost me $1000+ USD beyond the cost of the initial ticket that I booked.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,12/1/2022,3,3,2,1,3,1,Los Angeles,Santiago,True,Chile,False,International,latam unabl provid adequ support come flight chang issu leav custom fend fork ton cash fix latam 's problem recommend fli latam multipl connect 're book far enough advanc flight time etc might chang nearli imposs get itinerari correct purchas flight directli latam san lax scl came time check flight 18 hour take unabl check flight imposs via app onlin call latam support line abl confirm error intern book error ie 100 latam 's fault result actual seat first flight none four rep talk four hour could chang ticket help told option 1 cancel ticket refund 2 could pay 'chang ' flight 3 could open case someon would call eventu case open howev one call within next 12 hour point flight 6 hour takeoff call two hour time confirm option confirm one cancel ticket refund told want get refund ticket suddenli longer option person could n't explain also could n't anyth els advic rep gave patient find unaccept said could 'tri go connect airport check see happen although separ indic 'miss ' first flight entir trip would cancel hour first flight schedul take got email said tri reach address case howev miss call instruct get touch never receiv follow even call would late make airport flight time even stand airport lobbi answer call unaccept gave latam 1200 ticket gave headach stress custom servic team abl fix even basic issu custom expect pay airlin 's error custom servic rep also feel free hang happen least three time end buy whole new ticket trip almost 2x origin price sinc imagin buy intern flight day trip n't go cheaper origin latam 's flight schedul chang whole issu n't discuss cost six travel buddi 6 hour phone latam error cost 1000 usd beyond cost initi ticket book,-0.8934,0.074147727,Neutral,Negative

1591,LATAM Airlines,1,"""an absolute nightmare""","In January 2020, I bought a round-trip ticket from Sacramento to Lima for June 2020. Subsequently, the trip was cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I called LATAM and was told that I could hold open my ticket until the next year. My tour was rescheduled for June 2021 and I rebooked flights on LATAM. The 2021 trip was also cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I spoke by phone with a LATAM agent who told me my ticket would be held open until June 13, 2020. My tour was rescheduled by the tour company for June 2022. In early March 2022, I began trying to rebook my flights. This turned out to be an absolute nightmare and ultimately unsuccessful. I lost track of the number of attempts I made to rebook this ticket, but it had to be over 20. For about a week, I made several calls daily that resulted in waiting for extremely long times for my call to be answered, only to be cut off. I waited about a week before I started calling again. Now my calls were answered, but I couldn’t believe I was dealing with the same airline I had dealt with in 2020 and 2021. With one or two exceptions, every agent had such poor English that it was extremely difficult to communicate, I never really felt they understood what I wanted, and I, in turn, could barely understand them. Several times, I had to tell someone that I would just have to try another agent. The background noise level was extreme. I had to terminate several calls because it was impossible to hear. With one exception, the agents did not seem to know how to do their job. They told me, variously: that I should use the LATAM website (not seeming to know that you can’t use an open ticket on the website, nor book legs on other airlines), that it was not possible to rebook my ticket, that the flight I wanted did not exist (when I was looking at it on the website), that it was impossible to book SMF-LAX with them (after hearing that several times, I dropped the SMF-LAX portion and just focused on LAX-LIM), that I would have to go from LAX to LIM via Santiago and Miami, in that order (two agents told me this). Finally, I got an agent with good English on a clear line, who was able to book exactly what I wanted. When we were nearly finished, he put me on hold - and the call was dropped.

1603,LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""do my best to never book LOT again!","I was traveling with my wife and 1.5-year-old baby. They delayed our flight by 30-minute increments, and never gave us a reason why. The original departure was supposed to be 4:30PM. At 9 PM, after 10 delays and 5 hours of waiting at the gate, they told us the plane would only leave the next day at noon / 12PM. We didn't stand in line for the complimentary hotel because we could stay at our friends close to the airport, but the people told us next day that it took 3+ hours, or until midnight. The following day at 9AM when we checked in they gave us food vouchers but none of the restaurants accepted it. We never asked for food vouchers so this seemed like such a strange thing to make us even more irritated.  The plane was set to leave at noon / 12PM but they kept delaying the flight again by 30-minute increments and we were close to rebooking to another flight (where the customer service rep said that they probably won't reimburse us for), but then they finally announced at 4PM that we're ready to board. After sitting for an extra 2 hours on the plane, we finally departed at 6PM. We arrived at our destination 24 hours late. A minor irritant: We asked to have our carry-on baggage checked in because we were with a baby and it's easier to traverse the airport without having to tow that around. The first day they said they won't because the plane isn't full. At the check-in gate an hour later I asked if the plane isn't full could they perhaps secure a whole row (3 seats) for my family so the baby could possibly sleep between us. There they said the plane is full. The following day when we checked in again we asked if they could check in our carry-ons as well and they did so, no questions asked. So the first day someone was either lying or just not willing to even try to help out. I called customer service when we got in to see if we could have our return flight changed to a week later and they said that they can only change it to a day later per policy, because that's how much the plane was delayed. But, the day later date had a 16-hour layover vs our original 2-hour layover so they offered to shorten our trip by a day if we'd like. And to make matters even more mind-boggling I checked online and the 1-day later flight was actually more expensive then the 1-week later flight. They'd give me a more expensive return flight because their policy doesn't let them give me a flight that's further out than the delay we experienced.  Other irritant: None of the tv remotes worked on the transatlantic flight, so I couldn't even turn on the light or do anything with it really. Final irritant: The seat I sat in reclined but didn't stay there. So every time I leaned forward to get my book or grab a drink, it came with me, and then I had to recline it again, irritating the person sitting behind me. All of this with a baby in tow. He was surprisingly patient though, more patient than a lot of the other travelers, also slept through the whole flight in the end! So anyway, worst trip ever on LOT's part. And then customer service couldn't even give me a different return flight (apart from one with a 16 hour layover instead of our original 2 hour) after a 24 hour delay. All this for $2,700 USD.

When it was time to board for the flight to New Delhi, the flight crew wouldn't let me on the plane. They said i didn't fill out the Air Sudhiva form. I looked it up and it was just your standard ""I'm vaccinated, here's the date i tested negative, here is where i will be staying etc."" entry form. I didn't know it was required on top of the visa.

My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would “do what they could” and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: “You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt”. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: “Thank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you.

1627,Lufthansa,1,"""does not meet expectations""","I think the fact that Lufthansa states “We are aware that due to the steady increase in personal and business travel, we are currently unable to provide you with the excellent service you have come to expect from us” says it all. When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind “unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect” - this was well below “does not meet expectations”. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we’d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I’m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We’re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are.

1655,Norwegian,9,"""a great product for the price""","Have flown Norwegian over 30 times in the last year both short haul and long haul. This trip was a long haul from San Fran to Stockholm via London. I am a big fan of the airline. Almost always on time. Very friendly crew, especially in the long haul operation. Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay. Short haul they are more flexible with the rules on baggage but long haul they always check.

The cabin crew was professional, courteous, and attentive, even passing out menus in economy which I haven't seen in years. Hot towels were passed out before landing, again a nice touch. After a smooth and wonderful flight, what spoiled everything was that not all of our luggage was delivered. The baggage personnel stated that my son's baggage 2 pieces, and my wife's baggage 1 piece was pulled and not loaded on our aircraft due to possible weight issues which I don't believe, as none of this was ever brought to my attention when we checked in our luggage. My wife and son completed the paperwork for the missing luggage and for compensation. The baggage personnel stated they would load the baggage on the next day's PR 101 and deliver to our hotel.

1676,Philippine Airlines,1,"""left me feeling angry and frustrated""","I had purchased a business class ticket with high expectations, only to be extremely disappointed and frustrated throughout the entire journey. The 14-hour flight from Los Angeles to Manila was extremely uncomfortable due to the absence of remote controls on our seats, which meant we couldn't even watch any movies or programs during the flight. Despite their acknowledgment of the defect, the compensation offered by the airline of only 5,000 bonus miles each was not enough to make up for the inconvenience caused during our honeymoon trip. Unfortunately, the issues didn't end there. We experienced serious deficiencies in service by the check-in counter personnel, gate agents, flight attendants, their teamwork, and the in-flight facilities. It was an unpleasant, frustrating, and even traumatic experience for us. The check-in personnel at LAX Los Angeles Airport were not professional and their hysterical attitude made us feel unwelcome. We were even forced to purchase tickets without regard to the date because the boarding time was near, and her words were threatening. Furthermore, the baggage manager demanded an excessive baggage fee for my 5'5"" surfboard that we were already permitted to check-in during our previous flight from the US to Hong Kong. To make matters worse, my surfboard was broken upon arrival in Hong Kong. Additionally, the remote control for our seats was broken, and we weren't even informed until after we asked for their email address and emailed them. The flight attendants even stepped on my feet when preparing food, which was both painful and unprofessional. The experience traumatized us, and it was very disappointing to not have received a response from the customer service center for almost a month. It was a nightmare from start to finish and made our honeymoon extremely unpleasant. As a paying customer who bought a business class ticket, I expected better service from the airline.

We flew 4 sectors with PAL and all were significantly delayed. Transit in Manila was an absolute nightmare. Straight off our plane those also transiting were ushered into a corridor and ushered plastic chairs. No communication!  More than an hour later, we were given water. Then transit passengers were asked to move to the transfer desk.  After standing in a line for almost 30 minutes, our passports were taken and we were moved to another room – where we waited for another hour.  Next, we were moved into another line and our hand luggage was scanned and taken to small room we had to identify our luggage which was opened and tested (for what?).  Then ushered into a bus and taken to the next terminal.  Our baggage was scanned again upon leaving the bus and then we found the gate – our hand luggage was scanned again and all our documents were checked once more where the worker was meticulously writing down (by hand) passport and ESTA numbers and taking photos with his phone of every single document! 3 days before our flight home, we received emails saying our LAX-Manila flight was going to be delayed significantly, meaning we would miss our connecting flight to Sydney. After an ordeal trying to get someone on the phone or via chat and more than 3 hours on messenger, the best PAL could offer us was leaving on a flight from LAX a day earlier, a 28 layover in Manila and arriving home in Sydney 5 hours later. That was the best they could do. They did provide hotel accommodation and food vouchers however but to some no name hotel 30 minutes drive away. We were out of pocket with a non refundable night of accom we lost in LA, car hire and needing to pay for another night of dog boarding at home. The flight from LAX to Manila was a nightmare. TV remote was broken  Reading light was broken - The lie flat bed kept hitting the floor. On arrival to Manila, only 4 out of 5 bags had arrived.

Flights are generally good, mostly on time, great crew, lousy food. However, their website and booking/refund policies are the worst. Almost every time we fly, their website has a problem with my credit card, then we have to spend at least an hour to call them, find the reservation, verify everything, then pay over the phone. This week I tried to book a flight, credit card rejected 4 times (Southwest Airlines VISA card with $35K credit limit that I charge everything to without issues), called, and by time we got through all the preliminary stuff the low rate I had online was gone. So we had to choose between changing my wife's family time by a day, or pay a higher fare. I have fought with customer service repeatedly over these issues to no avail. The last time this happened the customer service agent said this is a known problem and they are working on it. Really? For 9 years? I had to cancel a flight during COVID, waited 5 months for refund. Then they never fully refunded the extra charge for a good seat. BTW, now all of their aisle seats are a $20 surcharge. I have had cases where I tried to book the flight online, credit card rejected, I call, the first person finds the reservation and confirms everything, then I get transferred to another person who has to confirm everything again, then takes my credit card info and processes it, then transferred to a 3rd person who has to confirm everything again and does the seat assignments. On any other airline you can do this online in 10 minutes or less, no problem. Maybe the extra customer service expense is part of why they're in bankruptcy. Bottom line, flights are OK, booking a flight is painful, and the only reason we fly PAL is they are the only airline with direct flights from LA to Manila.

1686,Philippine Airlines,2,"""refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars""","The flight from LA to the final destination Dumaguete via Manila was actually relatively pain free. Seats are uncomfortable after a few hours especially when you are 6 foot plus like myself. Food was borderline comparable to just about any experience you've had in your life when you wish you didn't eat something but I believe just about all airlines serve bad meals.  My first major complaint with Philippine Airlines is the cost to check bags. The two bags I checked from LA to Manila were free. Checking the same two bags plus the two my wife had resulted in a 200 dollar fee for the relatively short flight from MNL to Dumaguete. That domestic flight wasn't even half full so not sure other than the obvious greediness explanation why Philippine Airlines charges this much to check bags. My other main complaint is I had also booked a one way ticket to Bangkok from Manila. As the date for that flight was getting close to arriving, my wife's mother became seriously ill and was hospitalized. This event made it impossible to make that flight to Bangkok. So I contacted Philippines Airline to request a refund since I don't know when my wife's mother will recover and we could visit Thailand as originally planned. A one way ticket from Manila was 130 dollars but Philippines Airline adds 50 dollars in fees just to book the ticket. The amount they charge for refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars. Not to mention the hoops you have to jump through with their request hub submission process and the ridiculous 25 to 30 minutes you have to spend on hold when they make you contact them by phone to explain the same exact details provided inside the written request. I'm not sure how these airlines are able to stay in business but one thing is very apparent, customer satisfaction isn't any type of priority or concern.

1687,PLAY,1,"""reduced our chances of boarding the flight""","I am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the travel experience we encountered with Fly Play on flight OG102. I must acknowledge our own contribution to the problem as we were running just a little bit late for the flight and we fully understand and accept that responsibility. However, what followed left us perplexed and disheartened. Upon realizing that the flight was delayed by approximately 50 minutes, my husband and I, experienced travelers, considered this a fortunate turn of events. We proceeded to the check baggage counter, which was unmanned – understandable given our tardiness. We decided to get through TSA and inquire about gate checking our baggage at the gate. To our surprise, we encountered an extremely rude and unreasonable gate attendant. We politely requested if we could gate check our bag. Unfortunately, her response was an immediate refusal without providing any explanation. This was particularly disheartening as gate check had been a feasible option in the past, including with Play in September. Our attempts to seek clarification or speak to someone else were met with further hostility. The gate attendant claimed to be the sole authority and refused any further assistance, which left us feeling unheard and disrespected. The situation escalated when the gate attendant intentionally covered her name tag and displayed an offensive gesture towards us. We were unable to board the flight and learned from the chat bot that we were labeled as ""did not fly due to inappropriate behavior."" This statement is categorically false, and we were relieved when Play ultimately offered discounted tickets as compensation after hours of pleading via chat and trying to come to some resolution. Nonetheless, we firmly believe that the entire situation could and should have been handled more professionally and with greater courtesy by your employee, who represents your company's values and image. While we understand that being late reduced our chances of boarding the flight, we firmly believe that every passenger deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. We would have gladly accepted any reasonable explanation for not being able to gate check our bag. Instead, the encounter left us with a sense of shock and disappointment that overshadowed the entire travel experience. We sincerely hope that this matter will be taken seriously and addressed appropriately to prevent similar incidents in the future.

1689,PLAY,2,"""most miserable experience of my life""","Flying with Play was the most miserable experience of my life. The booking was easy, as was the check in. There were no delays and everything went smoothly. There is a massive issue however with the fact that they don't have a phone number. Never deal with a company that can't be contacted by phone. If anything goes wrong, you're on your own. While everything outside the craft was fine, inside the plane is a different story altogether. Firstly, getting seated was an absolute farce. The lack of organisation by the cabin crew seemed to rub off on the passengers. Several people switched seats, meaning some found another person sat in their seat. I've never seen this before on such a scale and I can therefore only attribute it to the fact that the cabin crew were not checking boarding passes or directing anyone. Getting seated took longer than I've ever seen on an aircraft and at no time were the crew trying to speed things along. The plane started taxiing with passengers still stood up. The main issue with the flight was the seats. I have never seen this many rows on this type of aircraft. There is no way on earth these things should be in the air for more than an hour. I am 5ft6 and I had so little leg room that I could not physically reach down to pull my bag up. If you are 6ft+ you realistically cannot fly this airline.  As if this could not be any worse, the seats recline. Yes. They recline. The room in front of me was reduced to level where I could not put my tray table down. It was 6 hours of absolute torture. Some passengers spent the entire flight stood in the aisle as they could not sit for that long. Everything on this flight is paid for separately. Fine. It's a budget airline. I get it. But water? Surely this is a basic human necessity. It was 3 Euros for the smallest bottle of water I've ever seen in my life. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Not only is it torture but it makes no financial sense. After adding in the extra legroom seat costs (you will need it), water and food, you are likely to be saving little to nothing.

Did all the things I could do in order to secure it in time (paid to have it expedited, contacted my local congressman, drove to wait on line to another state without an appointment to a passport agency, and called daily).

My only option was to change to another trip which included paying a change of ticket fee and any difference in the cost of the new ticket (which would have been at least $1,000.) I stated that I could not do that since I wasn’t sure if my passport would come in time for this newly booked trip.

1694,PLAY,3,"""Terrible experience""","Terrible experience. I’ll never fly with PLAY again. Our return flight on 11 February 2023 from Paris to Baltimore was to have a brief layover in Keflavik, but weather caused a delay. The delay then became a cancellation, which then became a delay again. Our departure went from 1130 to 2230 on Saturday 11 February 2023 as a result. After navigating the options provided to us we decided to accept the delayed departure, but because of the earlier cancellation, we had already booked with PLAY to depart on Sunday 12 February 2023 at 1130. We cancelled our taxi, had begun looking for a hotel near the airport, made arrangements for the care of our minor child who was at home in America, contacted our employers of the change and requested extra time off from work. All of this was for naught when the flight was merely delayed 11 hours. This required us to check out of our hotel, arrange for our luggage to be secured by them, schedule another taxi and spend extra time and money in Paris until the 2230 departure. At no point was an updated itinerary sent with the new time, nor were we sent an electronic boarding pass. Upon checking into CDG airport in Paris we were given our boarding passes to Keflavik, but no information regarding our next flight from Keflavik to Baltimore. No boarding pass, no explanation or departure time, no information from any employee at the PLAY terminal or from the flight crew while in flight or on the ground. We weren’t advised of where to go or what to do next. After landing in Keflavik at approximately 0300, we determined through a search that there is only one flight daily from Keflavik to BWI and the departure time was 1515 hours; an unplanned layover of approximately 12 hours. With no hotel availability, my wife and I spent 12 hours trying to sleep on hard wooden benches with all of our luggage piled around us. After showering, dressing and departing our hotel on Saturday we would now be faced with wearing the same clothes and no chance to shower till we arrived home over 36 hours later. We could not check into our flight from Keflavik to BWI until 1215; so we stayed close to the terminal that airport employees told us would be opened by PLAY personnel eventually. Passengers filled a “roped” off section near the kiosks where the PLAY check-in would take place. An employee told everyone inside the “roped” off area that they would need to move to a different “roped” off section which chicaned to 4-5 PLAY check-in counters. Passengers asked why they couldn’t just stay in the line and go to the counters. Her response was, This is not the line. The line is here, so you’ll have to go to the other line (not quoting, but words to that affect). This caused people to start ducking under the “ropes”, dashing around cordoned off areas into the other area or those of us who were outside to make our way into the designated area. There was no thought or consideration given to those who had been standing patiently waiting for the customer service counters to be opened. The bond female, then left and there we only two booking agents to deal with the throng of passengers waiting to check in. With 4-5 available “counters” there were only two customer service agents working. We were fourth in line and it took us 45 minutes to check in for our flight.

We were told the flight was full and that we could not sit together. That was a lie. We were told we didn't need a visa and allowed to board. That was a lie. We were told the food and drinks were out on the flight. That was a lie. I saw multiple people served and they never came back out again to finish up after turbulence had started. When I asked for some water they replied ""we will be landing soon, just wait."" Soon was 90 minutes. No legroom, no service, impossible to get in touch with customer service as there is no number. Attempts to chat online had my chats prematurely disconnected and then berated because I needed to be patient. I asked 4 questions that took 45 minutes to be answered.

But wow, what a great new airline. First time I have had young, attractive, friendly, helpful flight attendants (males and females). They wear red. They are cheerful. Not one unpleasant self-centred passengers on my trips. The airline is based in Iceland and the PLAY planes are red. Bright red all over. $404 dollars for a roundtrip ticket to Spain. For that kind of cost I have no problem bringing my own sandwiches and soft drinks into the plane. We had a lot of heavy turbulence in January flying over the Atlantic but the captain explained about the wind and current flows and assured us we were not going to die. I can't say enough good things about this airline and I have travelled all over the world for years and years. I used to fly Pan Am a lot so you can assume I am no spring chicken when it comes to flying. I hope PLAY stays a guarded secret (but successful) by those of us who have experienced it.

I assumed I could add my infant at in-person check-in but it took a whole hour and we had to pay fees equivalent to 1/3 of our adult ticket price. When sent the payment link, it was asking me to log in and didn’t have an option to create an account. It finally worked when I used a different internet browser - only to find when I got home that we were charged twice! We made our flight just in time (only because they boarded late and the ticketing agent escorted us through security) but our checked bag never made it to our destination. Upon arrival, we and 2 other families from our flight were missing bags and there was no one at the London Stansted airport to help us. Another airline’s agent tried and directed us to the online lost baggage form, which was not accepting any of our flight numbers. Finally, mine worked but the other 2 families had to fill out a paper form. A few days after arrival I received a text that my bag was found and being sent to the airport - and that status remained unchanged until I got to the airport to go home a week later. I got useless responses from a WhatsApp bot and never heard back on the email I sent, until after I had returned from my trip. My brand new bag (now damaged) had been at the arrival airport for a few days but the online status system was never updated to reflect that and I never received the email that the manager said she sent me. And the bag was certainly not delivered to my local address as the form said it would. Even after we collected the bag for the return flight, the status of the lost bag (on route but not yet delivered to the airport) was unchanged. For a week my toddler and I went without any of our clothes and without his medicines. It was incredibly frustrating to not have any real person to speak with. I don’t know how an airline can operate without staff in their airports and rely on robot communication and websites that don’t work. This airline has not invested the human and technology resources they need to support their customers. The in-flight experience also sucks.

First time flying Q-Suite of Qatar Airline, have heard many good things about it prior to departure which turned out to be exactly as advertised. You get your own spacious suite, comfortable seat, plenty of storage, great food, all are better than other business class experiences that I had. What really went well beyond my expectation was the cabin crew. From the time I boarded they have always been super attentive with prompt service of what I needed. Special Kudo to Amit the supervisor, Hattaya who handled my section with a smile that can light up the cabin, plus Chenny and Asil who both were in the front (Apologies to the rest of the wonderful crew whose names I didn't quite remember) Moreover, the lounge in Doha is just fantastic. There have been plenty of praise about the facilities so I am not going to repeat here. However I really want to point out that all the staffs are well-trained and always proactively helping out asking for our needs, which is not something I experienced in most of the business class lounge. They were also very serious about the work product they delivered. We ordered a steak at the dining room that turned out to be too well-done and not tender, we made a very slight comment about it and five minutes later the Chef came out and explained to us that they deliberately didn't leave it too rare and we are all travelers so they want to be on the safe side. The only drawback is the inflight WIFI. $10 for a full flight plan is very reasonable so I purchased it right on board.

It's been nearly 1 year while I wait for ticket to be refunded, 1 year. Just a moment ago, I got off the phone during my once a week call to the Royal Air Maroc customer service, asking if perhaps this is the week they will do the right thing and give me my money back. Sadly, no this isn't the week. The nice lady on the phone informed me it's only been 3 months since receiving my refund claim and that due to covid, things can take a bit longer. Well, let's start with the fact that the airline never notified me of the flight cancellation, and made zero effort to communicate with me regarding the cancellation, or credit or a refund for 6 months after they cancelled the flight. Once I finally reached out via phone call and email, I waited another several months with no reply. At this point, obviously frustrated, I began calling back more frequently and was finally notified that my refund claim was filed incorrectly and I had to file it again. So now nearly 1 year later, while chatting with this nice lady on the phone, she tells me that since I've only waited 3 months since my claim was re-filed, I simply haven't waited long enough. How long is long enough? At this point, it's pretty clear that I was essentially robbed by this airline, and the most frustrating part is that every time I call asking when they will do the right thing, they just smile and keep lying more.

They made a boarding announcement and there was no organization (see photo). No one told passengers where to go or what zones to use. Then, we waited. We were given the same RAM-standard statement, “You will receive information in 10 minutes.” This happened 2 times. People were getting very angry. Ground staff called security who came and stood at the counter looking menacing. Boarded the plane. Stayed on the ground for more than an hour with no information from flight crew. We could see mechanics staring up at the underside of the wing, not reassuring and most of the passengers around me were fearful to fly. We finally took off 3 hours after flight time.

Not only were the ticket prices high, but the food itself was incredibly disappointing. I expected much more from an airline that claims to offer a premium experience. The overall taste and quality were also highly disappointing. As someone who enjoys flavorful cuisine, this was a major letdown. I anticipated a delightful culinary journey, but unfortunately, it was far from it. To make matters worse, the portion sizes were incredibly small. I understand the constraints of serving food on an airplane, but the amount provided was hardly enough to satisfy even a moderately hungry passenger. It felt like an afterthought rather than a carefully planned meal. Furthermore, the lack of creativity in the breakfast offerings was disappointing. The meals lacked innovation and seemed to be basic, standard choices that did not leave a lasting impression. As a passenger, I believe it is important to have a breakfast experience that is not only nourishing but also enjoyable and memorable. Considering the ticket prices associated with Royal Jordanian Airlines, I expected a more diverse and enticing meals. Other airlines manage to provide a wider range of choices. Unfortunately, Royal Jordanian Airlines fell short in this aspect. Finally, the combination of high ticket prices and subpar food left me feeling dissatisfied and regretful of my choice.

My ticket was purchased through American Airlines as a OneWorld codeshare. American confirmed scanning the bag delivered to RJ264 before departure. After waiting at AMM baggage claim for the 1st 45 minutes after arrival, a baggage clerk confirmed that it was back there but still processing through security. At 1½ hour after arrival, the same baggage clerk said that now he could no longer find it back there anywhere. How could my bag have “disappeared” while processing through security and never be delivered to the baggage carousel? After filing my lost luggage claim at the AMM airport (along with several other 1st class pax), I have had had no response and no contact from Royal Jordanian airlines.

A few minutes before we were supposed to board our flight from JFK to Amman, the branch manager announced a delay in our flight without any details instead of allowing us to board the plane. Later on, it turned out that there was an issue with plane and the flight was delayed 5 hours. A few hours later they announced a 21 hours delay and as all passengers got frustrated, the manager announced that they are giving us a voucher to stay in a hotel for the night. They had all passengers picking up their bags. They lost my car seat and it took 3 hours for them to find it. After so many arguments, the shuttle to the hotel finally arrived with not enough space to accommodate all passengers and luggage. Then when we arrived at the hotel, there were no rooms to stay. They had to take us to another hotel Where we spent 2 hours until we finally had our room.  The next day, our flight was supposed to leave at 7PM. We ended up boarding at 8:30 PM instead. Rude customer service and the manager did not handle the situation in a professional manner as she should. No answers and rude treatment for the passengers.  Also at Amman airport, my bag went through bag check without announcement. I was waiting for more that 2 hours until I started asking around were my bag was. Someone told me that it was at bag check.

1799,SATA Air Azores,1,"""airline gets worse every year""","Boston to Terceira. This airline gets worse every year. They essentially have the monopoly in the Azores, as far as routes and usually pricing, meaning they don't care how poorly they treat customers. I have often had them tell me there are no flights available, only to arrive at the airport to see the exact flight I wanted only half full. I have flown close to 100 times, and almost a dozen times with SATA, and I have never been asked to weigh my carry-on bags. Any other airline doesn't generally care, as long as it fits. On 12 August, we were on a flight that was less than half full, on a large A321 with plenty of overhead and cabin space. I assume because they wanted to make some extra bang for their buck, they stopped every single person at the boarding pass counter and made them weigh every carry on. If you wanted to keep it, you had to pay $100 to check it, whether it had medications or anything. The average weight of just a carry on bag alone is 9 lbs, meaning virtually no carry on will ever be light enough to be under 17 lbs. SATA has a tendency to underbook flights and delay or cancel a lot, but why they decide to gouge everyone again at the counter is beyond me. This aircraft was also utterly filthy, as when we opened our tray tables they were covered in an unknown sticky substance. I would love to tell you to never book with SATA, but sometimes you don't have a choice.

1800,SATA Air Azores,1,"""refusing to respond""","My sister, brother, friend, and I were scheduled to leave Boston for Terceira, Azores on January 17, 2018 with SATA flight S4232. Unfortunately the plane was cancelled. We were given no reason why, just a letter to email SATA with questions. (No phone number was provided and when we asked the employee behind the counter she repeatedly told us to email customer service. The flight was not rescheduled until January 19, 2018, two full days later. This left us holding the bag for a hotel and rental car on Faial which had been pre-paid and we missed out on. We also had taxis, food, etc. in Boston while we were waiting to find out if our flight was going to be rescheduled. (Not to mention that the Azores in January is 50-60 degrees, while Boston was around 30 degrees! We were not packed appropriately at all and had to purchase additional clothing to compensate for the differing climates.) Since that time, I have sent numerous emails and Facebook messages to SATA. Their response, after months of emails to the customer care email are two-fold. One: “The contract that is made with the Airline Company, only contemplates the passengers transportation until the final destination. The reasons for which someone travels from one point to the other are unknown to the airline company, therefore, we can neither be held responsible when a passenger fails to show at a scheduled location, nor when other contracts are made with other entities.”  Our flights were booked through a travel agent but they are all with SATA. So SATA does know we were flying on to Faial; we were on their flight. And, moreover, they re-booked us through to Faial two days after our originally scheduled departure. Two, after months of asking for reimbursement: “If you have any expenses regarding any meals you had to make during that waiting, please send them together with your bank details information (account holder, name of bank, address of bank, account number, bic/swift code, routing) for their analysis and eventual reimbursement according to SATAs regulation.” Of course I have had no acknowledgement that they even received my email, or follow-up emails. To top things off, when they did rebook us, the airplane was decrepit. The heating/cooling system didn’t work. The seats were the smallest, most uncomfortable things ever. And the flight attendants were rude. My family and I had flown SATA in the past and had no issues.

1804,SATA Air Azores,1,"""no attempt to offer an explanation""","Boston to Lisbon return via Ponta Delgada. Left Boston with a delay as has been the norm for the last few years! The flight to Lisbon was uneventful of note the way SATA boards their flights: instead of calling the passengers by class, everyone camps right at the gate and so the process becomes a nightmare similar to a herd of bison on a stampede!  The real fun begins on my return to Boston where I had to arrive no later than October 20th at 9 pm. I got to the airport at 10 am, for my flight scheduled to leave Lisbon at 1:05 pm, on October 20th. My bag was checked in, my boarding pass handed to me and then, I was informed that the flight was 5 hours behind without an explanation! I told the SATA representative that I was going on call at 10 pm and had to be in Boston before that! She sent me over to their sales counter where I explained the whole thing again. She was kind enough to route me to a TAP flight leaving Lisbon at 12:45 to Newark where I would then fly to Boston on JetBlue and assured me that my luggage would be taken care of. Upon my arrival in Newark, I could not find my bag so I thought they maybe I would get in when I arrived in Boston. To my dismay I got to Boston and could not find my bag anywhere! I contacted SATA, TAP, JetBlue to no avail! I got an email from TAP and JetBlue, apologizing for the incident and informing me that they would try to locate my bag. I spend most of Saturday and Sunday calling SATA in Lisbon, Ponta Delgada, and Boston being given contradictory information stating that it was not their problem because I flew TAP and JetBlue. I explained to the persons that I handed my bag to a SATA employee and had a baggage claim to prove it! That was of no use. The folks in the US basically told me to get lost because it was not their problem even though I have been flying SATA for almost 20 years! My brother in Lisbon spent hours at the airport, trying to locate the bag, since, in accordance with safety rules a bag cannot fly without the passenger so we were hoping that the bag was lying somewhere in Lost & Found in Lisbon. After several hours, he was told that they could not help him. I kept calling my agent, SATA, TAP, JetBlue without any luck. On Monday, October 23, I got a phone call from Logan Airport, Lost & Found letting me know that my nag was found on the SATA carousel and luckily, it had my contact info on the pocket so they were able to contact me so I could come and get my bag! I did go back to Logan to get it and, to my surprise, they were right: the bag flew on my original SATA flight, un-accompanied, was never opened or checked to make sure it did not pose a threat to the safety of the other passengers. Even with the baggage tag, SATA was unable or un-willing to locate and deliver the bag to me! After all, in this day and age where unfortunately so many horrible things happen all the time, I can’t fathom how a real airline can allow for such a breach of security. I called SATA again, explained the whole thing and, to my surprise, there was no attempt to offer an explanation or apology and so I decided to not only publish this review but also to open a complaint for an investigation which hopefully will prevent situations that could escalate into a tragedy.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,10/1/2017,1,2,2,1,1,1,Boston,Lisbon,True,Portugal,False,International,boston lisbon return via ponta delgada left boston delay norm last year flight lisbon unev note way sata board flight instead call passeng class everyon camp right gate process becom nightmar similar herd bison stamped real fun begin return boston arriv later octob 20th 9 pm got airport 10 flight schedul leav lisbon 105 pm octob 20th bag check board pass hand inform flight 5 hour behind without explan told sata repres go call 10 pm boston sent sale counter explain whole thing kind enough rout tap flight leav lisbon 1245 newark would fli boston jetblu assur luggag would taken care upon arriv newark could find bag thought mayb would get arriv boston dismay got boston could find bag anywher contact sata tap jetblu avail got email tap jetblu apolog incid inform would tri locat bag spend saturday sunday call sata lisbon ponta delgada boston given contradictori inform state problem flew tap jetblu explain person hand bag sata employe baggag claim prove use folk us basic told get lost problem even though fli sata almost 20 year brother lisbon spent hour airport tri locat bag sinc accord safeti rule bag fli without passeng hope bag lie somewher lost found lisbon sever hour told could help kept call agent sata tap jetblu without luck monday octob 23 got phone call logan airport lost found let know nag found sata carousel luckili contact info pocket abl contact could come get bag go back logan get surpris right bag flew origin sata flight unaccompani never open check make sure pose threat safeti passeng even baggag tag sata unabl unwil locat deliv bag day age unfortun mani horribl thing happen time cant fathom real airlin allow breach secur call sata explain whole thing surpris attempt offer explan apolog decid publish review also open complaint investig hope prevent situat could escal tragedi,-0.7574,0.087337662,Neutral,Negative

I recently completed four segments with them and found that most of the complaints were not well-founded. To preface this, the reader should remember that Azores Airlines is a budget carrier. The Azores are a small region of Portugal that has been historically underdeveloped. If you keep these concepts in mind and adjust your expectations accordingly, you can have a positive experience like the one I had. I flew two segments on one of Azores' old A310s (BOS-PDL and return). There aren't many of these around anymore, and I was interested to see how it had held up over the 25 years of service. The planes seemed to be in good condition, with a couple of cosmetic exceptions. Legroom was not great, the flights were less than 5 hours. On one, we upgraded to exit row seating (20A/B) and had unlimited leg room. It was well worth the $65 PP cost. The other two segments (PDL-BCN and return) were on newer A320s. These also had limited legroom, but were in good condition. None of the four flights that I took were delayed; all arrived on time. I checked luggage on each. It was not lost. The meals were terrible, and there was virtually no in-flight entertainment.

After waiting 5 hours, Azores reps told us the flight was canceled; they had no more information and ""to check back tomorrow"". They offered a phone number to call, but the office is closed until Monday morning. At this point, the crowd became very agitated and we noticed that they had called the Boston State Police to control the crowd. Two passengers got into a fight over waiting in line. We were told that this happens on a regular basis & the State police were called out the previous Saturday. After calling around, we discovered that every hotel in Boston was booked for this Saturday night. Most people wound up sleeping on cots in the terminal. We finally found a Best Western 30 miles outside of town, arriving at 5am. The most frustrating part was that the airline representatives would not provide anyone any information at all. We returned to the airport the following afternoon and were told that we would be on the 9:30 flight, ""IF... they had enough crew show up"". Two other outgoing flights were delayed, another fight broke out and the State police showed up again! We finally departed at 2am on Monday morning.

We were due to fly from JFK to Delhi, connecting through Jeddah, on December 20th. Saudi proactively cancelled our flights from Jeddah to Delhi with no heads up. Pandemic and preemptive travel closures, sure. We had to call the customer service department multiple times just to cancel our full itinerary. They kept giving us the run around - telling us to contact their WhatsApp support line (more on this), or to email them. Finally, after no success on those fronts, they were able to cancel the flights on our 5th or 6th phone attempt. They claim the customer service phone department - where you can talk to humans - is completely disconnected from refunds processing - and you can only do the latter via WhatsApp or email. The WhatsApp support is the laziest, most lackadaisical responsiveness I've ever seen. They claim 24/7 support but regularly take 6-10 hours to respond to a chat and start a conversation. When they do reply (usually with 1 word or 1 line), if you don't reply within 10 minutes they close the chat out and you have to start the conversation all over again with another agent. - I repeated this cycle for 4 days on repeat just to be able to submit a simple refund request for a flight they cancelled. Phone support was unwilling to process a refund. Once I did eventually get through a submit a refund claim via WhatsApp, the phone agent was unable and unwilling to give me any indication of refund status.

The first problem occurred before my actual travel date, when I received an email informing me that my return flight time had been changed to two hours earlier, which meant I would be getting up at 5am to make the return flight. The REAL problem began when I arrived at the airport in Tampa to find that my departure flight had been delayed for at least 4 hours. I received no prior texts or email regarding the delay, and was forced to spend the next 6 hours at the airport, again with no updates except those on the terminal screens, as Silver Airways has no app, and there was no representative at the gate. The person I dealt with at the Silver Airway ticket counter was one of the rudest individuals I’ve ever met - bored, annoyed, and with no people skills whatsoever, sighing heavily when I asked for possible flight alternatives, with more concern for her 4 inch fingernails getting chipped by the computer keyboard than for a paying customer like me. When she told me there were no other flights that day, I asked about changing my return flight to a later time so I could spend more time at my destination, at which point she told me that I wasn’t even booked for a return flight. When I produced my printed confirmation email, she just said, “Well, I don’t know what to tell you.” When I asked if I could speak with someone else, she picked up the phone and called someone else, who evidently told her that the only return flight was already fully booked and I could make no changes. She then hung up before I could speak to that person myself. I went to the United ticket counter (since I’d originally booked with them) to see if they could help me, only to be told that I had to deal with Silver, as all in-state flights had been subcontracted to them. Stuck at the airport for the next 6 hours, I waited for the delayed aircraft to arrive with no more updates other than the terminal screens, only to discover that the aircraft was a small turboprop, which I would never have agreed to had I only known. Finally boarded the plane 4 and a half hours later than scheduled, having to drag my luggage across the tarmac and up a very steep, very narrow set of stairs - not an easy task for a 64 year old woman - with no offers of assistance from the ground crew standing by and watching me struggle.

Finally I arrive at the airport at 10:45 to make sure I make my 12:10 departure time upon arrival at the airport they delayed it to 1:10 am. Once I arrived at the gate I waited there until which the worker at the desk stated to all of the passengers that the crew had timed out and they will be delaying the flight until 10 am the following morning. Many passengers were frustrated including one women who told the assistant at the desk that she had driven 3 hours and doesn’t have money for a hotel and hopes they can put her up for the night in a hotel. The same worker told the lady “There’s nothing I can do for you because it’s not our fault so it’s not my problem, you can sleep in the airport”. I was completely in awe of the absolute disrespect silver and their airline employees showed to passengers who payed a lot of money to get to their destinations on time safely. The following morning I arrived at the airport at 8:30 to make sure I will make my 10 am flight. I then was told that the flight was delayed until 12:30 pm. So after waiting 4 hours until 12 PM all of the passengers were seated at the gate and waiting anxiously. 30 minutes from our expected take off there were still no crew members at the gate, no pilots and the plane was parked on the other side of the tarmac. The pilots finally arrived but still no crew members at the gate. We continued to wait with absolutely no update of any kind and we’re further delayed passed our expected departure. After numerous attempts to contact silver airlines there was no response and it said there was nobody available at the call center and to try again later. I had tried 6 times to get in contact with no answer.

It was no problem with Delta to get to Orlando easily and smoothly but once Monday came, Silver Airways was a nightmare and continues to be. First thing, flight got delayed and delayed and delayed so we ended up with an email saying 7:12 pm flight out and then their website saying 6:11 pm the former delay prior to this. (Our flight time out of Orlando was originally 2:35 pm. That’s fine, flights get delayed I get that. No problem. So as we stood in line for over an hour, we began to realize we weren’t moving and still not moving much and we were going to miss our flight. The people all in front of us were angry because of the lack of service and common sense the Silver Airways staff showed. The lack of simple “I’m sorry that your flight is cancelled, but here’s what you can do” didn’t exist and when it was our turn and we had just missed the flight, this is about 7:15 pm now, we walk up and speak to the agent who has no idea what to do and says that. Literally says to us “I don’t know what to do and what you want me to do” excuse me? So after asking her what can we do? How do we re-route? She informs us in a nasty tone and attitude that they don’t do that. They didn’t help. They didn’t do a thing and refused to help.

On the way back home., the flight was two hours late departed the gate again. Where I was finding out about the rescheduling, the girl at the desk was very rude, and did not seem to know what she was talking about. When we got on the flight, everything seemed Okay, to about the halfway point to our destination. Then the power came. The intercom said that if the disability was too bad too land, then, the plane would have to turn around and head to Tampa. As we arrived into Tallahassee, they started to descend the aircraft. Then all of a sudden they brought the aircraft back up again in a very jerking movement. Then they got back on the intercom and said that the plane would be diverted back to Tampa. Then I asked flight attendant, would they arrange hotel accommodations for everybody since we had to turn around? She said they would take care of the hotel combinations and then get everybody back on the plane, for the next day. As we arrived in Tampa pilot got back on the intercom, and made the announcement that the plane would leave you in Tampa, then head back to Fort Lauderdale. I asked the pilot and another flight attendant about the hotel accommodations, and they said that, they will not be responsible for hotel accommodations or to arrange for the return home flight. We would have to make all the accommodations ourselves. Those who want to get off in Tampa when they were refueling, would go ahead and get off the plane. And those who wanted to go back to Fort Lauderdale, would just stay on the plane. There were other major problems problems when we arrived inside the building. The ground crew told us, that we had three choices to make. Either get back on the plane and go to Fort Lauderdale. Or we stay in Tampa, and take our chances and fly out the next day on a flight that could only seat 56 people and they were already at least 30 people who decided to get off the flight. And, the last choice was., go back inside and go to the desk and request a refund for the meaning of the trip. They said, if you purchased your ticket through a website that was not the airlines website, then they would put a reference on your account, so is the agency where you bought your ticket from, can see it, and they can apply the refund. Once we got inside, we were told that those who bought tickets off of another website, would not get a reference on our account for them. Every bit of information that we’ve been told, what is wrong.

We had a return flight booked through United Airlines from Ft Lauderdale, FL to Tampa, FL in the afternoon. United apparently partners with Silver Airways. We were never sent a link or reminder to ""Check In"", so we had no way to do a mobile check-in. We called Silver Airlines and the Rep said ""we can't tell you if it's going to leave or not"" We then looked at the United App, it said ""Delayed"". The departure time now showed 4.5 hours later. We called United and the Agent said the flight WAS LEAVING AS SCHEDULED and didn't know why the SA Agent would tell us otherwise. But interestingly, United's App did show delayed. So then there's that. We called Silver Airways 3 times over the next few hours and they kept telling us they didn't know if the flight would leave or not but that we should just show up at the airport anyway. To quote her ""just come to the airport and you'll be good to go. We don't know if the plane will leave or not. Sometimes they need to do an oil change."" This is where I lost my head. Amongst other choice words, I told her I could rent a car and drive to my destination in 3.5 hours. I wasn't going to make a trip to the airport and wait for a flight that ""may or may not happen"". I need to know now if the flight is on schedule so that I can make alternative plans. How can you tell your passengers you don't know if their flight will leave or not? She put me on hold to speak to her supervisor, then returned and said, yes the flight would leave on time. This caused us 6 hours of confusion and angst. It ruined our plans for the day in Miami, since we didn't know if or how we would leave. In all of my years, I've had delays, cancellations, interruptions...yes, even oil changes....but I've never been told maybe it will go and maybe it won't. I'll just have to wait and see?

I had my passport, Bahamas Travel Visa, a letter from my physician, and an exemption letter from the ministry of travel of the Bahamas granting me an exemption to the testing requirement as I had recently recovered from Covid. One ticket agent questioned my lack of a negative Covid test and another agent ended up stamping us approved after some discussion. We cleared security and proceeded to the concourse where we had lunch and checked with the gate a few times to make sure flight was on time etc. As we approached the gate 45 minutes from departure, we were being paged.

We boarded and had to deplane the aircraft 3 times before they canceled our flight. They advised that the first two attempts were aborted due to mechanical problems but provided no reason for the issues with the third try. They removed the checked baggage from the plane and dumped them on one of the baggage carousels. As my wife and I were trying to make arrangements to get back home we were notified that the flight was back on. We collected our bags and took them to the the Silver Airways ticket counter and rechecked them. We then went back to the boarding gate finally getting on the plane and departing Ft Lauderdale. This was 11 hours after we were suppose to have originally left. After arriving in Jacksonville we went to retrieve our checked bags and discovered one had not arrived. There was no one at their counter to file a missing baggage claim. I had to go behind the counter and retrieve their local phone list, calling all the numbers until I finally got someone to come to the desk and process my lost baggage report. The next morning I received a call from the Fort Lauderdale Airport lost and found department advising they had my missing bag which they would hold for 30 day. I have tried to reach Silver Airways using the only phone number they provide and have emailed there customer service department and have not been contacted except one time. I was called back by a representative who barely spoke English who I provided all the pertinent information to regarding the missing bag including that the bag was located at the Airport lost and found and the lost and found claim number . I also provided the claim number for their lost luggage report and was advised they had no record of the report being filed. I was put on hold and then they hung up on me.

My family were scheduled to fly last April which of course was the beginning of the real shut downs on travel. Obviously, things were going on that following up on the ticket was not top of mind. In November, I had enough bandwidth to go back to revisit. At first I was told it had been refunded and was sent a receipt with the date of refund and the CC# that I had paid it on. After some research, I found it had not been refunded. I then emailed guest relations as another avenue since I was not getting anywhere with the initial rep and asked what was going on. I was told via email that the money had actually been put in a travel bank with a user ID to login and check. After multiple attempts at requesting a password, to no avail, I called back to find out what was going on since the date I was hoping to travel was fast approaching. The rep on the phone discovered that the User ID I had been provided was in fact not me. Days pass and I'm given a new User ID and successfully manage to log into the travel bank only to see that there was nothing in it. I ask what the status is once again through email and am told it should be resolved in the next few days. Three days after the date I was told it would be resolved by, there is still nothing in my travel bank and the prices keep going up beyond the value of my former ticket, which, if they had done this correctly in the first place, would have been covered by my balance. Now, it is looking like I have to cancel the trip again because of their incompetence. I don't have my money and I don't have a flight. It's appalling.

Wine offerings were insulting, flight attendants pour no more than 2"" into the small glasses, since that was the serving in the 3 requests we made. The Cabin Staff were polite, courteous & professional, but not nearly as service oriented as Qatar or many other 5-Star airlines. We found it quite telling that SG used the Air India Lounge for their business class passengers at JFK, even though Air India is regularly rated as 1 of the lowest quality airlines Worldwide.

I was initially in 2A, but moved to 9K in the second business class cabin when I saw some kids a couple rows behind me. Big mistake because there was a young woman two rows behind me who wanted everyone to know that she was there and travelling in business class. She fussed over everything, talked loudly from her seat to a passenger behind her, flirted shamelessly with the male cabin crew and in the middle of the flight, when everyone else was asleep, talked a full volume in the galley. I had to get and tell the crew to tell her to shut the hell up. To no avail. Then, on final approach to ACC, she was sound asleep and couldn't be woken up. She was a complete idiot. At one point, she stood in the second galley and pointed to the first, larger business class cabin and announced, ""that must be business class, but where I am (the smaller second business class cabin) must be first class because it is small"". A complete idiot. Shame on the crew for letting her talk so loudly in the galley in the middle of the night. Service was ok but definitely no way near the standard of many airlines. The business cabin was just over half full, but the crew did the minimum possible.

I asked what about priority boarding for unaccompanied minors (the 8 and 5 year old) she shut that down. I explained I need my kids to sit together please. I asked about priority boarding for military. I explained they have military ID cards and I will have mine on me as I plan to wait with them at the gate to see them off. She said “Sorry but no priority boarding for them, we don’t do that.” She was so rude. I explained these kids are new to this routine and it is the 5-year old first time flying w/o mommy with her.

1932,Southwest Airlines,2,"""why would I ever fly with them again""","The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an ""A"" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble.

Some backstory - I just graduated college and am supporting my fiancé as he finishes college. After doing year-round school, I have about $2,000 to my name in addition to student debt I still owe. Since we are paying for our own honeymoon, we wanted something very affordable. We were planning on just going somewhere local when my fiancé's parents shared a 48 hour deal for Southwest tickets to go to Hawaii. They offered roundtrip tickets to 4 islands for under $350. We were ecstatic! Since my fiancé was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit naïve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fiancé right away.

We made our way over with me hobbling in horrible pain as it was hard to walk. As it got closer to the time to board I didn't notice any signs of Ft. Myers, Florida so I went to the desk and asked the gentleman what was going on. He looked at my ticket and said I misread it and that my gate was C64 - the opposite end of the airport. We took off at a dead run and ran the whole way even through 3 conveyor walk ways while he radioed ahead that ""there's a woman and two children running your way."" All I could think about was making this flight. As I got closer I heard 3 times, ""Flight 1383 to Fort Myers is fully boarded and if you want to make this flight then you need to come now or the door would be permanently locked."" I was frantic.

1953,Southwest Airlines,1,"""I am disgusted with Southwest""","I am handicapped in that I have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old. I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight, as I always do. This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair. She told me to sit down and one would arrive. This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine. Well, I sat there for over half an hour, periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair. They said it was ""on the way"". When my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes I began to panic. When I asked at the desk again, the woman said, ""why don't you just walk?"" I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed. At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it. I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she ""worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers"". Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate. The plane was boarding. It was very clear that, had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me, I would have missed my plane, my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home. This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances, not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job. I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this, but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs. When I called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair (in this case there was no wheelchair OR pusher) and I know that's not true. If they don't want to provide this service it should not be offered when I book the flight. Then I would go to another airline.

1957,Southwest Airlines,3,""" lack of concern from Southwest""","I am quite disappointed with Southwest. I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing. I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards. I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May 16th, 2023. After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50).

1958,Southwest Airlines,1,"""nothing short of a disappointment""","I recently had the misfortune of flying with Southwest Airlines, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a disappointment. From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises.

But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret.

Will you actually get there, or will they cancel your flight? Well, I am not lucky in cards - so my flight got cancelled just because. No inclement weather, no real reason. Just the fact that Southwest is incapable of doing their job of scheduling and has no care for their passengers time nor plans. So what they refunded the money?

A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan.

One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner.

She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean.

I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful.

2012,Southwest Airlines,1,"""I went home bagless & exhausted""","On Saturday 12/24 I was at the airport by 10:15 for my 12:15 boarding of Flt 2909 to Manchester. I'm always early. It was delayed to 1:45 then cancelled by 11:30. Got on line, no flights to Manchester so I booked one to Boston that stopped in Tennessee first, I think that was Flt 3223 scheduled for 5:45 PM & landing after midnight. I took it. I will pay the $200 + for car service to get to New Hampshire. I went downstairs got my bags from the Manchester flt & checked them for the Boston Flight. Went through security again. At 3:30 that flight cancelled. They told me I could rebook for Monday morning flt 3159 several stops but you stay on the plane to Boston get in 6 hours later. I booked it. I was told my bags would be downstairs again. I went downstairs was told over & over again by the staff downstairs my bags would be down as soon as they could. 8 hours later when the baggage doors closed I was told no more bags coming down I could speak to a manager but there were no managers downstairs, I could go upstairs. I did & guess what, no manager there either. I went home bagless & exhausted. I asked at least ten time & was told the bags will be here. There was no real security watching these bags I had the Christmas gifts for my family in one bag & all my winter clothes in the other. I would have left, if I felt they would be secure. I wish I had. I stayed home Christmas my 3rd flt was cancelled. I tried calling Southwest on hold the first time 3 hours had to hang up & then 4 hours on hold & then disconnected. I went back to the airport on 12/26. Got on line 7:15AM to try again, to get a flt. to Manchester. I was on that line for 4.5 hours. The reason it was so long is that we were not important to Southwest They had 3- sometimes 4 employees at the counter & 3 & sometime all 4 of the Southwest employees would take the A list people that just walked into there lane, that haven't waited more then 5 minutes. So basically the group of over 150 to over 200 people were left with sometimes, one person, who was at the end of the counter, to assist them in finding a new flight. How disgusting! How belittling to treat your customers with such disrespect. I finally rebooked & now for the last time I'm going to try to get to Manchester on 12/28. Now, I go downstairs to get my luggage, you know it, not happening. Its no where to be found, so what are my options a line, 2 hours later, I get into the luggage counter and ask, where is my luggage? My last flight was flight cancelled yesterday? Well the young man says, one bag in is Boston & one is still in Tampa. I didn't go to Boston but my bag got a spot? I told him the other bag is not here I looked for it several times. He said well it could be on a cart somewhere & we don't have the staff to look for it. You had the staff to send one of them to Boston? Was it an A list bag? I asked how do I get my bags? He said once you land in Manchester you can request your bags. What? Now you want me to get in line in another state? I know that Boston doesn't fly to Manchester? So what you're telling me, is they will fly my bags somewhere else & then to Manchester? Do I get the mileage points or do my bags get them? Also by the time my bags get to Manchester, if, in fact, they do find them, I will either be in NY or back in Tampa. The only warm clothes I own are in one of those bags.

The gate agents provided very little information during the delay other than they were waiting on a pilot to come in off another flight. During the wait time, the pilot that did show up ""timed out"". Eventually the staff announced the flight would not leave until 5:15 am the next morning. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit's shenanigans. Vendors close early at Detroit Airport. For those of us that could not rebook a flight, no food vouchers were offered, no hotel vouchers offered and if you wanted to rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered (no other Airlines) forcing Spirt customers additional days of delays. When it came time fly out the following morning, a pilot was late causing a flight attendant to time out. In 9+ hours, Spirit couldn't get their stuff together even leave close to on time the next morning. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit's CEO, and Spirit's customer service agent was useless. Do not fly this airline! They do not deserve you!

2033,Spirit Airlines,1,"""Most horrible airline ever""","3 friends and I planned to fly from Boston to Santo Domingo on June 22nd via Orlando and had the most horrible experience. Flight NK2086 from Boston to Orlando was delayed by about 2 hours, and although we asked ground staff and stewards on the plane to communicate with the plane in Orlando so they could wait for us, they ignored our requests. When we landed in Orlando and got out of the plane (after it was delayed another 20 or so minutes because the gate was occupied), I heard an announcement that boarding would close for the SDQ flight in 1 minute. I sprinted to the next gate followed by at least 8 others trying to make our connection, only to find the ground staff at the gate to close the door as we arrived. We were then told to go to the counter to rebook our flight. It was at least a 1hr wait in line because there were so many stranded Spirit passengers from various flights, and by the time it was our turn, the alternative flight we had seen online was already full. The staff told the 4 of us we were already rebooked for the same flight the next day, meaning a 24 hour wait. Since we didn't have that time and didn't want to be stuck at the airport for 24 hours, we asked to be refunded for the missed flight and our bag fees. I asked if they would cover our hotel (and potentially meals) since we would have to stay overnight at the airport (especially if we would have gone with the offered alternative of waiting 24 hrs). They said no, I asked if we should sleep on the ground and they said yes. We ended up booking a flight with a different carrier that left early morning, still forcing us to spend the night at the airport and no sleep. Plus losing a night at the AirBnB that I paid for in Santo Domingo. Besides this horrible customer service and no compensation for the whole situation, on the way back it got worse. One of my 3 friends already planned to go back to Boston on Tuesday June 27 instead of Thursday June 29, but with the same flights. When he arrived at the airport, he found that the staff had canceled the entire rest of the reservation instead of just the one leg of flight we missed. Even though he had his flights in the Spirit app in his itinerary the entire time up to when he got to the airport. So he ended up being stuck at the airport for another night and having to book at his own expense another flight (very expensive last minute), and it took him a total of 2,5 days to make it back to Boston. The rest of us didn't want to be in this situation and ended up booking another flight since we didn't trust the app, because it had still shown the reservation for him as well. When confronting Spirit about all of this mess and the extra costs incurred, they took zero accountability for the lack of communication between flights. They refunded a small amount for the missed flight on the way there and gave some travel credit (why would I ever fly with them again), but not for bags ($100 each way!), or any of the expenses incurred with booking new flights, missed time and food/lodging.

During the text chat I explained the death of my family member and they gave their condolences and ask me to send over either a link to the Obituary, the actual Obituary, a death certificate or a doctor’s note. The one I sent was the link to the obituary since the others would take time. It took all of 30 seconds to tell me that I did not meet the policy. I didn’t understand and I asked what did the mean? They said that I bought the ticket after he had died and I explained that I had not yet received word that my family member had died and I was out of the country when I made the reservation and got the word the following morning. Needless to say I didn’t have the patience to text back and forth and explain myself and I asked again can I just receive a credit, i’m not trying to get away with anything, I just want to go to a funeral. So, instead of wasting the dollars that I had spent to go to waste. I decided to fly through MCO and fly to my final destination, where the funeral was. I confirmed my flight and checked in and headed to the airport while reading what I can take onboard with me as a personal item. I have a over night carry on briefcase.

I am stopped and asked to fit my bag in a make shift square which fit but the wheels prevented the bag going clean through meanwhile there were backpacks people were carrying twice the size of my briefcase. I really don’t get this policy if you cannot enforce all sizes of back fitting in that same square.

I’ve worked in the Airline industry before actually as a Transportation manager for a catering company that actually serviced Spirit Airlines out of LAX. This was my 1st time actually flying on Spirit and I had my reservations about doing so, just based on the reputation but I placed my faith in believing my experience would be different. Yesterday I arrive at LAX for my flight to San Juan Puerto Rico about 2 hours prior to departure. I head to kiosk to print my boarding passes, and when I put in my confirmation #. I received a message that I’m checking in too early and my flight is scheduled to leave tomorrow - please see an agent. So then I must stand in this line to get to an agent for over an hour. I learned my connecting flight to Detroit was cancelled. When I finally got the counter the agent told me that my next flight out is in 2 days. My trip was from Monday to Friday now this issue has caused me to lose 3 days out of my trip and if I flew out Wednesday night I basically would turn right back around. I was looking forward to this 1st time trip to Puerto Rico but it looks like that has been delayed. The only options I had was to take the flight change or refund. Obviously I had to do the refund as I was losing on my reserved hotel room that I had for this 2 days, and honestly there was no way I was going to go through the nightmare of getting home. I cut my loses and then proceeded with a refund. As much as I had planned and anticipated the trip all the joy was lost. At the time I’m writing this I should have already landed and been taking in the island but since my vacation was canceled I returned back to work for a vacation I had planned for months.

2085,Spirit Airlines,1,"""the entire experience left much to be desired""","Disappointing Experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com. I recently booked a flight for my sound engineer on Spirit Airlines through Expedia.com, and unfortunately, the entire experience left much to be desired. I had planned a trip from San Antonio, Texas to Norfolk over the weekend, which involved four flights due to layovers. However, my disappointment began when Spirit Airlines abruptly canceled the trip on the day of departure at 5:30 am, citing a lack of staff. This lack of preparedness and consideration for their customers time and plans was extremely frustrating. One would expect that in such circumstances, the airline would provide a refund or alternative arrangements for affected passengers. Unfortunately, this was not the case for my return trip. Despite the cancellation being caused by Spirit Airlines, they refused to issue a refund. This kind of inflexibility and lack of accountability is certainly disappointing, especially during these trying times where every penny counts. One of the reasons I had chosen Spirit Airlines was its reputation for affordable fares, but the overall experience has made me question whether the potential savings are worth the frustration and inconvenience. Moreover, the lack of customer support and understanding from the airline only exacerbates the negative experience. Additionally, I want to express my dissatisfaction with Expedia.com, the platform through which I made the booking. While I understand that they act as a middleman between customers and airlines, I expected better assistance and support in such a situation. It would have been helpful if they had intervened on my behalf to secure a refund or explore alternative options. In conclusion, my experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com was highly disappointing. The last-minute cancellation by Spirit Airlines due to staff shortages, coupled with their refusal to provide a refund for the return trip, demonstrates a lack of responsibility and customer-centric approach.

2103,Spirit Airlines,1,"""Avoid them at all costs""","I am a vibrant 78 year old woman and I have travelled internationally for most of my life so I am not easily intimidated by the challenges that air travel can involve. That said, I have never experienced a worse airline anywhere in the world and I strongly recommend that you pay whatever the cost to travel by any other airline but Spirit. I chose them to travel to Virginia from Texas because the flight times were convenient and my outgoing flights worked just as planned. My return flight experience was a total nightmare. The hub for Spirit is Ft. Lauderdale Fl. When I checked my luggage in Richmond, My bag was one pound over the 40 lb. limit and the Spirit representative told me i would have to remove and carry items to reduce the weight or pay for a second bag. That was only the beginning but it was the least of my problems. We flew to Ft. Lauderdale for my connecting flight to Austin, and right up to departure time the monitor at the gate said the flight was on time. At the time the flight was supposed to be boarding I asked the representative at the gate if I had missed an announcement of a delay and she said the flight was cancelled. There was nothing on the monitor to indicate the flight was not leaving. She was rude and unhelpful when I asked if there were later flights. I found a customer service desk for Spirit and the two women reps were chatting and ignored me for several minutes. When one of them checked on flights to Austin, she said my best option was to fly to Baltimore and connect to Austin there, getting me home at midnight instead of 6 pm. So I waited for 5 hours to fly to Baltimore and when I got there I found that the flight to Austin was not the same day. I had to spend the night. In Baltimore i asked a Spirit rep if they could recommend a hotel and she was rude and said I should have arranged that in Ft. Lauderdale. By this time it was midnight since the plane was late leaving Ft. Lauderdale. A woman in baggage claim helped me identify a hotel and I spent $20 on a cab and $140 on a hotel. The next morning I flew to Austin and of course my luggage was lost. So by the time I got home, without my luggage I had been traveling for 26 hours for the flight that was supposed to take 5 hours with a layover. The Spirit employees main goal is to get you out of their face. I thought it was due to poor training, but I soon realized that they already know the system doesn't work to help their passengers so they don't even try. They just cop an attitude and tell you your out of luck. And if you call on the phone, the call center is somewhere where no-one speaks English. Not a coincidence. It is part of the system. This trip was the most expensive I have ever incurred flying to Richmond where my daughter lives. In the end for the cost of the tickets, the baggage fees, the seat fees and the hotel and cab fare, I spent more than $800. I could have flown 1st class on any other carrier for less. The stress and exhaustion of traveling for 26 hours and being treated horribly by every Spirit employee is something I can't describe other than as my worst nightmare.

Really? Do you think maybe they could figure it out before putting it into service? Do they think the same way about maybe the landing gear as well? Or the bolts that hold the seats down? Don't even ask what is going on with the temperature because the ""experienced"" flight attendants are not going to lower themselves to taking care of the problem, they just say they have notified the captain about the issue and they will glare at you if you ask more than once.

I had to hide in the forward rest room and block the air vent in there to get respite. Very uncomfortable. This last trip (or non trip) was the straw that broke the camels back. I arrived as I usually do early by at least 1.5 hours and waited at gate 16 even though the marquee read 'FRONTIER AIRLINES TO ORLANDO FLIGHT 1194 TIME: 8:42 STATUS: NOW AT 9:02' which meant to me that my flight was probably delayed, so when I inquired I was told my flight had boarded and they gave my seat away even though no effort was made to call my name which is easy to do. I have a very distinctive name. By then 4, count 'em, 4 agents were busy making sure the plane was full and couldn't accommodate me. Even though I later found out they still had one seat available when my partner inquired with the home office. On top of that they tore up my boarding pass so I couldn't show it to bolster my complaint. I also turned in a lost purse during my wait time to gate 15 so that would prove even more I was there at the gate and ready as was another fella who was also denied boarding. I can't tell you how much arguing ensued when all this came down.

Sun Country refused to issue a refund for the rental car since it was less than 2 days from departure, a policy that I find exorbitantly unfair and far from customer-friendly. I also contacted Avis, the rental car company; I discovered they would have only billed me upon car pick-up, indicating that my cancellation incurred no loss on their part. To add to my frustration, I found that the rental car pricing offered by Sun Country was more expensive than alternatives like Expedia or Kayak. It became evident that these other platforms provided better pricing and allowed for cancellation without charges. Reflecting on this experience, I regret bundling auto rental services with Sun Country Airlines. The lack of transparency, customer consideration, and higher costs was disheartening and left a bitter taste. From now on, I will refrain from bundling services with Sun Country Airline, a lesson learned at a steep price.

Because we were in Seattle the customer service desk was already shut down for the day so we had to wait until the next morning to get help. The customer service rep was very kind and helpful (the only reason to give an average customer service rating). She confirmed the cancellation was due to crew issues. The next available flight for our family was in 7 days which is obviously not a valid option. She did offer a full refund and we have received that. But we had to rebook 5 new tickets for the next day which also added another hotel night and rental car day. It cost us an additional $2500.

2166,Sun Country Airlines,1,"""probably one of the best experiences""","Reading the reviews for this flight before we left on our trip I was a nervous wreck expecting something to go wrong. After my experience with this company I felt it was important to leave a review for those like me that have severe flying anxiety. My first interaction with this company after booking happened when I noticed that I failed to put middle names on my booking so our boarding passes would not match our passports. I called the service number and left my call back number. I had already read that no one answers the phone so I was prepared to be disappointed by not receiving a call back. A couple of hours later a young lady called me back and I explained my mistake. Her response was ""Well let's get that corrected so you can be at ease have a great trip."" She corrected 4 middle names on my booking and emailed me a new itinerary while staying on the phone with me to make sure everything looked ok. Disaster averted. We then got to the airport on Sunday to find out our flight was delayed. Again, after reading the horror stories of delayed flights being cancelled and people being left to fend for themselves I began to feel very high anxiety. One of my adult children would be flying from a different airport but same airline into Mexico and I was afraid she'd be in Mexico by herself. The flight was an hour late but finally showed up, they very calmly unloaded the passengers coming into Houston and got us all on the plane as quickly and well organized as I've ever seen. The flight attendants personally apologized to the passengers as we boarded for being late explaining that there were severe storms at their last stop and that they had to wait it out. I don't even know where to begin about our experience with our flight home. From Mexico, coming back into America, you must check in at the counter to show your negative covid test. Of all the check in counters, it was the shortest line, the staff was friendly and very patient with everyone, and they went above and beyond to help us get checked in and to our terminal in time. Wonderful service. I have flown on several airlines and take several trips a year and this is probably one of the best experiences I have had flying (that included set backs). There's a lot of bashing this airline for things that anyone could avoid just by doing their research or reading their booking information. The seating is no different than other airlines. The drinks come with a cup of ice just like every other airline. Oh there's phone chargers on the backs of the seat legs which I have never seen before. That was cool. We got free WiFi.

2182,Sun Country Airlines,1,"""I was so disappointed""","I am writing based on an a poor experience I had with a Sun Country Airlines flight credit/voucher. Back in January 2020 I had made a flight reservation for my family from Denver to Minnesota for May 7, 2020. However because of the safety and health concerns and overall halt of essentially all activities related to the COVID pandemic, Sun Country offered me the opportunity to cancel my flight and for which I was issued a credit for future use. I was very pleased and grateful at the level of customer service Sun Country offered in such uncertain times-outside of anyone's control. However on June 28, 2021 as we are exiting the pandemic and the CDC has advised it is safe to travel again, I went to use my airline credit, only to find out that the credit has expired. After waiting for over an hour on the phone to talk to a customer service rep, I was met with hostility and an absolute disregard and resounding lack of accommodation or alternative to my situation. I consider traveling by air an expensive privilege and one that I am extremely grateful for but one I do not have the luxury of doing so very often. I am also conscious of cancelation/rescheduling charges and terms during normal times but during these unprecedented times, I think it is so important for businesses to value their customers and vise versa. I was so disappointed at the lack of transparency by Sun Country when this credit was issued and I was not fully informed that the credit would expire. The lack of transparency by Sun Country coupled with the uncertainty of traveling until deemed safe by CDC and federal officials made planning future plans almost impossible and now that it seems like the nation is in the clear, Sun Country has made it unattainable for me.

We were not told about an expiration date, and were not given any extra confirmation or verification for this credit. I called customer service recently to look up my credit, and it had supposedly expired a month prior. I was told there was nothing I could do about this.

2184,Sun Country Airlines,1,"""I was so disappointed in this whole experience""","We have flown Sun Country for years and have always had pretty good experiences. Well, that officially ended today. We booked a short trip before the pandemic to get a little break from our toddler before our second baby came. We never actually went on the trip though: Sun Country cancelled the flight because of the pandemic. Fine. We understood. My husband immediately called Sun Country to see if we could get a refund. They refused but did send us an email about an electronic credit we could use toward a future booking. There was nothing in the email about the credit expiring. Today, I tried to use the credit toward a new flight. The website said the voucher was worth $0. So I called the helpline and spent over two hours on hold and speaking to two different agents (after getting hung up on by the first one when being ""transferred"" to a supervisor). First they tried to say we couldn't use the credit because their records showed that my husband had cancelled the flight, which isn't true. We booked through Bookit.com, and they sent us an email saying they would cancel the flight within the next 7 days if Sun Country didn't cancel it first. My husband didn't call until the flight was actually cancelled. Once we had that established, they said it didn't matter because the credit was only valid for a year from the date it was issued. I told them the email we received about the credit had no expiration date or even a disclaimer that it would expire at all. They said they sent two more emails about it expiring, which we conveniently never received. After getting hung up on by the first agent who was supposed to be transferring me to her supervisor, I had to call back and wait on hold for another 30 minutes to start the whole process over again with a new agent, who said her supervisor had reviewed our case and denied the credit, so she wouldn't even speak to me. I told the second agent I was so disappointed in this whole experience that we wouldn't be flying with them in the future, and she said, ""I understand. Is there anything else I can help you with?"" Yep-you can transfer me to Delta Airlines.

2205,Swoop,1,"""could not care less about customer service""","Do not fly on this airline. I know that no airline is perfect and that there are tons of things that can go wrong from a logistical standpoint, but how the company handles this is important. Swoop could not care less about customer service. There is no working phone number to speak with a CSR. Emails are unanswered. Tweets are promised a 72-hour turnaround time. The FB Messenger bot is useless. Do not fly on this airline. We were actually booked on another airline LAS - YYZ but wanted to go home earlier. Swoop had an early afternoon flight (as did AC and WestJet, but we wouldn't be able to sit together). We booked it with extras - checked & cabin baggage, priority boarding. When the agent took our bags only then were we advised that the flight was delayed several hours. Although it was about 2 hours before the flight was originally scheduled to depart Vegas, the inbound aircraft had not even yet left Toronto. The departure was ultimately put off to 5:30 pm and we were each given a $10 meal voucher for our trouble. My originally booked flight, which I had to cancel, departed on time at 5:05. (Flair). When the aircraft arrived at the gate, the boarding process began with our zone 1. We passed through boarding pass scanning, and were met with a long line of people waiting to board in the jetway. We were towards the back of the line, near the entrance to the jetway. We waited there about 15 - 20 minutes before some people in hi-vis jackets passed by us and then quickly came out to abruptly tell us the flight was cancelled. We immediately re-booked on the later, red-eye AC Rouge flight 1704 (which was excellent and on-time, by the way). We had to be in Buffalo by 11am on Saturday. That red-eye was our last chance to meet that deadline. Swoop later emailed us with a link to book an overnight room and rebooked our flight to the next morning, Saturday Nov. 12, at 10am. It ultimately left late, at 11:50 am, arriving in Toronto at 6:30 pm, about 24 hours later than originally scheduled. Do not fly this airline. Literally choose anything else- rent a car one way if necessary. Since we had only just bought our ticket that same morning, I certainly assumed that getting a refund would not be a problem. It has now been well over 72 hours with no communication whatsoever from the airline in response to our many inquiries, and no real way to reach them. You are better off walking. Although Swoop said that the delay was somehow due to customs & immigration delays (even though the passengers on the inbound flight YYZ - LAS would have all precleared US customs in Toronto), I suspect that the real issue was that the delay had taken the crew out of its allowed time for service, and they had a mandatory rest period before the flight could resume on its way back to Toronto. Why do I think so? Because I sure didn't see any new crew show up and I was at that gate literally from 11:30 am - 5:30pm.

We had to get off the plane, go through passport control, pick up our suitcases and go and stand in line to do the check in again. We were in line for more than one hour because many people in front of us had to rebook connecting flights. Four hours later we left Brasilia for Sao Paulo. We spent all that time at the airport and the ground crew did not offer any refreshments. The plane from Brasilia to Sao Paulo was half empty, however, the flight attendant did not allow us to change seats so that we would have more leg room. The flight from Brasilia to Sao Paulo was just over one hour long and we arrived more than 7 hours later than originally scheduled. It is amazing that the crew could not work for just one more hour and instead about 300 people had to be inconvenienced and many missed their connection.

Ranging from terrible customer service, unusable and oftentimes broken IT/online services, and wildly ridiculous policies, this airline is far below its competitors. Although its prices are cheap for trans-Atlantic flights, cheaper airlines have offered me better service than TAP. A 2kg weight limit for a personal item and a 12kg total limit on carry-on and personal item being strictly enforced on most flights is a ridiculous policy which delays boarding and leaves passengers stressed and dissatisfied. I have never had problems with my carry-ons, but witnessing so many other passengers arguing for up to an hour prior to boarding because of this policy has been extremely frustrating. The website usually barely works, and the airline has clearly prioritized capitalizing on unsuspecting passengers with sudden fees right before boarding or during check-in to reel them in with low prices only to leave them with no other option but to pay large fees at the gate. This is a common scheme of low cost airlines that I have been all too familiar with, but TAP goes above and beyond with their policies of unfair fees for passengers, leaving them with the option of paying or being stranded. The one thing I enjoyed about TAP was the in-flight service and leg room, which is equivalent or better than it’s competitors.

When I checked in at the TAP counter in Boston, they could not even issue me a boarding pass for the Aegean flight, but they said I would be able to get one from an Aegean agent at the departure gate in Lisbon. What's strange about this situation is that I booked the ticket directly from TAP on their website and NOT on a third-party site, where one might expect to encounter a difficulty such as this. In Lisbon I was unable to get what I needed from a gate agent, so I had to retrieve my bag from baggage claim, go thru Portugal immigration, find my way to an Aegean counter in the main terminal area, get a seat and a boarding pass, and make my way back through security and to the departure gate, lugging my bag and carry-on the whole way, and all within the time I had left after exiting the first flight.

On both occasions, we were told the aircraft had to be changed to another one without an entertainment system. The plane was older than the one advertised and with uncomfortable seats. It makes me think that maybe they only have this one plane in their fleet which they pretend to be their entire fleet. The outbound flight was delayed for over 3 hours. We were told at first it was due to the change of aircraft but then when I asked for compensation they blamed it on the weather. I was also charged a fee of £90 for overweight which is not mentioned anywhere on the flight. I even called them the day before and their customer service couldn't tell me how much it would be or if I'd be charged at all. Service on board was very unprofessional. The crew was very loud, especially on the night flight, it was impossible to sleep with the noise they were making by talking to each other and to passengers. They were also completely out of sync. The front of the plane was a mess with stuff spread all over the floor. I was on the first row of the plane and they kept bumping into me throughout the flight and throwing the curtains at me. Getting a glass of water during the flight seemed to be a huge trouble for them. The food was disgusting and portions were small. There was a single round of complimentary drinks on a 7-hour flight.

We received a text message/email an hour or so before leaving for the airport saying our flight had been delayed by 4.5 hours however the check-in desk will still close at the normal time, meaning we need to check in almost 6 hours prior to flying at the latest. Upon arriving I asked the check-in agent if they are about to close and she said no, not until an hour before the flight. When I complained about the delay and the fact that we now have hours and hours to wait all evening in the airport (!) when I had a suite still available to hang out in, I was flat out ignored, the member of staff refused to answer questions and proceeded to hurriedly check in our luggage. Eventually she pointed at a '4-hour pre check-in' sign and said well you need to check in 4 hours early anyway. I explained that I had never heard of that in my life (how would a sign help if you're not at the airport yet) but was ignored (I later complained to someone else who explained this was when they opened and was only an advised time - I showed him the TC website which states the standard 3 hours and told him how rude his colleague had been). The agent did not apologise or show any empathy or understanding. A colleague came over to explain further and provide a $10 meal voucher but also did not apologise or seem to care very much. She pointed out they are just third party staff and to contact TC. A little later I went back to complain to a manager and the agent just said there wasn't one. Then nothing, we just stood there. Eventually a more experienced colleague overheard and took over apologising for the confusion on behalf of TC. Well eventually we got on to our flight and the pilot apologised and explained the reason for the delay (repairing faulty smoke detectors). Service was okay, not great. Entertainment, food etc I'm not really sure about as I was semi-conscious the entire way but I get the impression it's a more budget style airline doing long-haul flights.

2234,Thomas Cook Airlines,4,"""like long haul Ryanair""","Manchester to New York JFK return. This was the most stressful outbound flight experience I have had. I arrived over 2 hours early for my flight to NY and was greeted by absolute chaos in the Manchester check in area - enormous queues of passengers just not moving and angry ""priority"" passengers yelling at staff as normal queues were moving faster than them. Eventually they opened more desks and things got moving but it was nearly an hour by the time I got to check in. Outbound my hand luggage was 8kg (so 2kg over the 6kg luggage allowance) which I hadn't realised as I booked the flight the day before for a surprise visit my fiancé had planned. Most other airlines have a 10kg hand luggage allowance so the 6kg is unreasonably restrictive IMO, and is clearly not a safety thing as ""premium"" passengers are allowed 10kg. As we were only going for the weekend I had packed a trolley case with very little inside and since my partner lives in the states I took the chance to use my baggage allowance to pack some items we had not yet been able to take out there like bedding etc which was in a sealed box. The guy on the desk was adamant I had to lose 2kgs or pay £95 to check in my hand baggage. I asked if I could pay per kilo I was overweight as I had no way to repack the sealed box and could not afford to pay the extortionate check-in fee which is higher than additional baggage charges I have paid on other airlines when I genuinely have had to check a bag in. He was (rudely) adamant no. So I relented and said well if I had to transfer into my checked bag which was only 15kg then I needed scissors and tape to open and reseal the box. ""Not his problem"" apparently, and I was told I had to find somewhere else in the terminal to do it or pay the £95. Long story short the baggage storage counter was nice enough to let me use their stuff but I think the rudeness and disorganisation of the staff and stingy, inflexible and ridiculously expensive baggage policy is enough to put off flying with them again. By the time I got my bag checked the flight was boarding and I had to run through security to get to the gate. Had the same enormous check-in queue issue at JFK on the return leg, where the queue at 7pm for a 10pm flight was so large they had a separate side queue area before you got to the queues at the front of the desks. Credit to the 5 desk staff there though it did move reasonably quickly. My in-flight experience was supposedly better than normal due to them issuing a free upgrade to ""premium"" entertainment which was frankly poor in comparison with other airlines I've recently flown to USA with (Delta, Icelandair). On the return I had 5 films to choose from. Food was ok, but no complimentary drinks except a bottle of water and trolley drinks are expensive. There was a constant push to sell you stuff - you have to sit through 4 adverts back to back before you can watch anything. It really is like long haul Ryanair but with a stricter baggage policy. It took an hour after landing for my bag to come into reclaim so having got through immigration that was a 40minute wait, meaning I missed a train connection by 2mins. The gate from JFK also had no seats and we had to be bussed out across to the plane which was miles away.

I checked on the punctuality of this route and found that the plane often took off about 15 minutes early but almost always arrived on time or a bit earlier. That was the case with my flight. Cabin baggage in economy is limited to 6 kg. My carry on bag was easily 15 kg but since I was not checking a bag I figured that once I checked in I would simply print my boarding pass and go directly to the gate. I know Logan airport well and there are no scales at the gates. But I was wrong. It is impossible to print a boarding pass from home. Everyone must go to the check in counter. Because of this, I had to check in one bag and make sure that my carry on was under 6 kg. I also put my laptop in another small bag which the check in person didn't see. Once my bag was weighted no one ever questioned it or inspected it. I could have had a friend waiting for me and simply stuffed my bag after checking in, or simply left my bag with my friend and arrived with no bag whatsoever. So beware. You must be careful as they weigh all carry on bags at Boston. The flight was fine. Free meal (chicken or beef) and free muffin and coffee before landing. Everything else costs money. Cans of beer were 4GBP! No individual screens on the seat backs, just drop down screens like in the 1970s. No problem. Seats were a bit tight but otherwise fine. Staff was lovely.

2248,Turkish Airlines,1,"""do not know what I did wrong""","At the end of January I wanted to book flights online for the end of April to Turkey in such a way that we first fly from Prague to Istanbul, stay there for a week and then continue to Antalya for another week and then from Antalya back to Prague via Istanbul. But you can't book that online like that, so I called TK customer service and asked how I should book that. The information was that I should book 2 tickets and reserve min 3 hours on the way back for the change in Istanbul. I did as instructed, booked the tickets and also had over 3 hours to change planes, arriving in IST 13:40, departing to PRG 16.45. In the weeks and months that followed, I kept getting text messages from TK saying they were changing the schedule, changing planes, etc. Most of them concerned changes of times because of the time change to daylight saving time, but one concerned the flight from AYT to IST where I was secretly rebooked on a later flight, which I unfortunately did not notice. There remained however still 1 h 45 min for the change, which is well enough. Already on the way to the airport I saw that the flight will be delayed. At the check-in, however, the boarding pass was issued to us also for IST-PRG and the luggage was checked through to PRG. The delay was then according to TK on 1 h 16 min, so quite that is not true, we took a long time to the arrival gate, where we arrived at 16:20. Already on the plane I asked several times how it would work with the connection and the last information was that I should grab the first TK employee at the exit and let him advise me. I did and the TK man at the gate told me to go to the departure gate as quickly as possible. Anyone who knows the new IST airport knows what that means. Nevertheless, we made it to the gate by 16:45 (we are both 68 years old and my last gold medal in the 5000 m run was several decades ago). But of course there was not a soul at the gate. Again I grabbed a TK employee, who referred me to the customer service counter, where of course the obligatory queue was waiting. When I showed the ""Pre-sorter"" my boarding passes, he told me immediately that no more flight today and I should wait here, so that TK look for a hotel and book new tickets. When it was my turn, the lady looked at my papers only briefly, and explained to me that I had no right to any compensation because I had booked 2 tickets. No one responded to my question about how I should have booked and they referred me to the ticket counter next door, where I had to wait almost 45 minutes for my turn. For 2 tickets to Prague they wanted $700! When I went to book the tickets online, I came up with around $500, but the lady told me she couldn't take that fare and I should book online. With the hotel and cab and dinner this story came me to over 600 € about 200 € more than the whole original booking. Since then I have been arguing with TK, repeating everything I'm sure 10 times already, but all I ever get to hear is the gramophone record: ""You were late at the gate and had 2 tickets, we are not to blame"".

This email gave no alternative flights or assistance to get another flight, they said it was canceled. When I called Turkish they stated I could cancel the entire ticket or go home on a different day, not much of a choice. I couldn’t get credit for the second leg, even though they only canceled the second leg. I moved my flight to one day earlier and left my trip on may 2nd causing me to incur charges for the hotel stay for a night I couldn’t use. Day of the flight the flight was delayed over an hour with only a 2 hour connection to my second flight on their airline. I asked if I would miss the connection and they stated I would not and the plane would be held because we would land about 6pm and the flight started boarding at 6:50 pm instead of holding the plane they had an agent get me off the plane as soon as we landed and I thought I was being rushed to my flight, but no they were rushing me to the lounge because they had already booked me on another flight the next day. So I lost another day of my vacation because I had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I also had to get a visa for Istanbul unexpectedly because I had to leave the airport. None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours. No email or text form Turkish airlines. We get inside the airport and flight still shows on time, I call Turkish and they said it was on time.

So why weren’t we told because again we are going to miss our connection to their next flight. So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home).

2260,Turkish Airlines,1,"""the worst travel experience of our lives""","We were loyal Turkish Airlines fliers for many years until this experience. Our saga started when we purchased 4 business class segments for my wife and my honeymoon in February 2022 for almost $8K. Due to Covid, we tried to change them over the course of the next year. This airline has arbitrary change fees that are not listed anywhere on their website. They are allowed to quote you whatever fees they would like at the time of the change request. As such, we were told that our new tickets would need to be roughly $5600 to qualify for the change, with an additional $600 per ticket change fees, so $9k in total for a $5600 flight. We agreed, but disputed the change fee with Amex. Amex found in our favor for $600, issuing the credit and we looked forward to our honeymoon. Fast forward, we arrived to the gate in February 2023 for our new flight and were told for the first time that our tickets were *suspended* and that we no longer had tickets. After speaking to ticketing agents and phone agents, both of which said there was nothing they could do (more on this later) we finally were able to speak to the Newark sales manager who was highly unprofessional and unhelpful, trying to convince us that we were not owed anything and essentially ""too bad"". In the end, we were forced to purchase last minute economy tickets for almost $4K with a one way upgrade for $2500, as we did not want to jeopardize our hotel reservation and ruin our honeymoon further. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, like many here, we emailed the feedback form many times (as others noted, this airline's phone personnel have no authority to make any financial decisions and all must be done via online feedback forms). We received many unhelpful responses, refusing to give us any compensation or help us in any way. All references were made to speak to ""our bank."" Finally, we decided to upgrade our economy leg home for another $2500 and take this matter up when we got home. In the end, we paid about $8600 just to have to pay another $8.5K and fly in two 8 hour economy segments versus the 4 business segments we originally purchased. I'm sure that in the meantime, Turkish resold our original seats last minute for much higher than the original $8k we paid 5 months before the flight. In short, this was the worst travel experience of our lives and showed clearly the unethical business practices of this airline. 1) They will suspend your tickets without notice, forcing customers to purchase last minute segments at the gate. There are numerous other cases here of flier having their tickets arbitrarily suspended. 2) You will not be able to make changes, receive refunds or do any customer service action of any value through the phone with them. You will be forced to use an antiquated online ""feedback form"" that does not even track your previous correspondence.

First, check-in for Polaris at SFO was surreal, with 50+ people on line and only one agent actively checking Polaris-class passengers in.

I arrived at the terminal two hours before my United flight but got only 20 minutes in the lounge as a result of this mess. Second, United's boarding process is a slap in the face to passengers who pay upwards of $7000 for a seat in Polaris. If you're not a member of one of their frequent-flyer levels, you're forced to board with economy-class passengers. Every other airline in existence lets passengers in the premium cabin board first, before the coach stampede starts with people pushing and shoving to board so they can get first claim to overhead space. This is one reason why I will never fly United again. Third, my berth in Polaris was filthy, with lint and crumbs littering the air vent along the bulkhead. Fourth, the food in Polaris was virtually inedible. Again, when you're paying upwards of $7000 for a ticket, you expect something that isn't going to make you gag.

Our departure to SFO was delayed by 3 hours because the flight crew was delayed getting in to DFW and needed their 8 hour rest. This meant we would miss our connection. As it turned out, the connecting flight was cancelled. The agent at check in would not rebook us on another airline nor put us on standby. Our bags were checked through to YVR. The agent in the United Club put us on standby for the next flight from SFO. Unfortunately, we could not get on this flight nor 2 other flights that we were on standby status. As a result, I ended up booking one way flights on another carrier to Seattle, stayed overnight and then took the bus to YVR so we could attend the first of 4 wedding events. The flight itself was fine; however, the baggage is another story. Our bags never made it to YVR. I spent countless hours texting with United Baggage over 5 days. We received conflicting messages about our bags being in YVR. We missed a pre-wedding soiree because we spent 4 1/2 hours at YVR airport looking for a bag that wasn't there and had to buy every day clothes plus clothes for the wedding. On Monday July 3, I received a phone call saying one bag as in YVR. I requested the bag to be delivered to our hotel. On the day of departure from YVR, the bag still hadn't arrived. I received a call while going through security that 2 bags would be sent to DFW and delivered to our home address. The bags were delivered to our home on Friday July 7. The garment bag that was supposed to be delivered to our hotel before departure on 7/6 is still in United's baggage system. 24-48 hr delay is excusable; however an entire 8 day vacation without baggage is totally inexcusable.

2320,United Airlines,1,"""no one knew where my bags were""","Departure flight: Firstly, let me express I live in Atlanta, GA. We have one of the largest Airports in America, therefore, I understand the 2 hours plus rule. From the time I arrived in Newark, it was a terrible choice. My first leg on United Airlines was ATL to EWR, I arrived to Hartsfield Airport (ATL) to discover my flight would be 1 hour and 45 mins delayed. Not a big deal to most but I had a connecting flight to Denmark, Europe. As it got closer to the boarding time, an United assistant began to yell on the microphone, ""Y'all have to hurry and board or we will go illegal and you will have to wait longer"". If anyone came up to ask a question, ""Y'all have to hurry and board because we are about to go illegal"". She informed us, they would start boarding sooner due to them about to go ""illegal"". Finally, we are all boarded on the plane, we waited an extra 30 mins to taxi due to them allowing another United flight that was supposed to depart at 10ish pm to board our flight, they said we were not full so they could get more passengers on my flight. While this delay occurred because we have multiple people with the same seat. These genius people did not think about this. Secondly, I arrived at Newark, and it takes United 30 mins to get an associate to hook up a ramp for passenger departure of the aircraft. The pilot continues to apologize over the microphone several times. I literally had 5 mins to get to my connecting flight; it was pointless to even run during this time. I reached the United help desk to informed them I'd missed my connecting flight due to their delay, the woman assisted me by trying to get the next available flight but all of them made me miss my anniversary, which is the day I would have arrived to be with my spouse. At this point, they give me a hotel because I had an international flight. I asked several times if my bags would be on the new flight I'd been given, the United assistant reassured me they would. (It was not on my next flight after delayed for 10 hours.) The assistant gave me a meal voucher of $15 for breakfast and lunch. They provided a Lyft to the hotel, by this time, it was 12 am. The hotel was about a 20 min drive, and I felt like I'd passed a million hotels to arrive at such an unsatisfying one. You would have thought I was in a motel 6. After a 10-hour delay, I started my travel back to Newark (EWR), my international flight was on time, I was so happy to be away from this unprofessional airport. The staff was horrible going through security check out. I arrived to Aalborg, Europe to discover, no one knew where my bags were. I'd missed my anniversary and now I have absolutely No clothes. Returning flight: From Aalborg, Europe (AAL) to dreadful Newark (EWR), I arrived at Newark Airport (EWR) again but this time I had an 8-hour layover. I'd learned from my first experience to just take the extra time if you can. I put myself into the Newark International Airport Marriott, which is only 5 mins from the Airport.

Now, this by itself was very frustrating and meant we would miss a whole day of our vacation, no vacation and no work meant we were losing money by the hour, add onto that was the unhelpful attitude of the flight crew, the several different reasons given for delays (ranging from weather to flight crew deficiency, to plane malfunctions) and this was just a really bad day. We stay in San Francisco for an entire day and are back at the airport for the new flight. Now, the airline did provide us with a hotel (pretty bad one that smelled like smoke) and a few food vouchers, but we weren't very happy with them. The next flight gets delayed again and again until finally at about 2am (was supposed to leave at 8), they cancel the flight for another set of ambiguous reasons. at this point, there are 400+ angry people waiting in one line with about 2 agents and they are turning people away without so much as a hotel room. At this point we decided we would not be flying United, we've missed two days of vacation or work, we've been treated poorly and compensated only the bare minimum. We finally speak to an agent and demand monetary compensation as well as a refund for the cancelled flight (airlines are required to refund cancelled flights), and they refuse. They tell us there will be compensation but where, when, how is left ambiguous. We ended up flying Delta, completely smooth as wonderful process. Though we continually call, fill out forms, send emails, and the like, we have yet to see a dime of compensation for this truly terrible experiences. We stayed in touch with some other people on our flight and they continued to have problems with United (missed connections and the like) and were never compensated. The best that they were able to do was offer $300 vouchers for another flight. Are you kidding me? You think a silly $300 voucher could make up for the money we lost and the horrible experience we had? Not likely. As we are never planning to fly United again, a voucher is honestly just an insult at this point. We also heard that the employees of United are so disgruntled with the company that they are planning a strike.

This two hour delay would have resulted in missing our connection and the international flight from LAX to MEL, but we found a flight out of CLT to LAX with absolutely no help from the AVL United employee (he gave us a phone number to call and sent us on our way, saying there was nothing he could do for us, even though he had just finished helping the couple in front of us with the same itinerary delays). Made it to LAX in time to catch the initial flight to MEL after booking the flight ourselves. Made it to our seats only to wind up sitting on the tarmac for two hours due to a flat tire caused by “running over a washer” (read: negligence) on the runway. By the time the tire was fixed, the crew was over their authorized hours, and the flight was canceled. We were told that we would be rebooked to our initial destination (Melbourne), but we were rebooked to Sydney, which is about 539 miles off our initial destination. In order to solve this, we were directed to another United customer service desk where we stood in line for an hour with 50+ United customers dealing with similar “rebooking” issues. It was 2:00 am by the time we were able to talk to a United customer service employee, and good god I wish we hadn’t. For two hours we stood at that counter and did not get a straight answer to our questions, ie.)

2351,United Airlines,1,"""refused to compensate us""","Shocking treatment by United Airlines of 2 elderly people and an infant, leaving us stranded and paying over $1,000 for hotel + food over the Boston Marathon weekend - and when we filed a complaint, United refused to compensate us even one cent! We were flying from Boston to Calgary, Canada via Newark with my two elderly parents (one of whom has a back problem and gastrointestinal issues) and my 5 month old baby, who was flying for the first time in his life. On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us that the Boston-Newark leg of our journey was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane’s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were informed that the earliest available alternative was not for another two days on April 18th, 2023, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days. They also confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which was within their control. We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary on April 18th. We were appalled that United was not able to re-schedule us for two full days.  Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere. We incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport. Our total additional expenses during our delay period WAS USD 1,110. We filed a detailed complaint with United Customer Care. It took them close to 2 months to reply to us, and when they did they vaguely blamed the weather (first time we heard of this excuse!) and refused to compensate us at all.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,4/1/2023,1,1,3,1,2,2,Boston,Calgary,True,Canada,False,International,shock treatment unit airlin 2 elderli peopl infant leav us strand pay 1000 hotel food boston marathon weekend file complaint unit refus compens us even one cent fli boston calgari canada via newark two elderli parent one back problem gastrointestin issu 5 month old babi fli first time life morn schedul departur unit told us bostonnewark leg journey delay earlier delay impact plane arriv mean would suffici time make newarkcalgari connect spent 25 hour phone unit tri find altern flight inform earliest avail altern anoth two day april 18th 2023 even though show great flexibl eg will connect via differ citi split famili flew differ airplan accept longer connect time despit unit said absolut option us fli anoth 2 day also confirm reason earlier delay board aircraft take longer expect within control look fli anoth airlin cost lastminut ticket thousand dollar per passeng therefor prohibit expens meant cancel unit flight get refund feasibl solut unit offer us option arrang flight differ airlin carrier without addit expens contrari right canada 's air passeng protect regul appr therefor accept new unit itinerari april 18th appal unit abl reschedul us two full day destin citi calgari small town popul 145 million peopl activ intern airport stuck boston busi boston marathon weekend forc us stay expens hotel 2 night plan could find last minut accommod elsewher incur addit meal cost transport cost airport total addit expens delay period usd 1110 file detail complaint unit custom care took close 2 month repli us vagu blame weather first time heard excus refus compens us,-0.765,0.053504584,Neutral,Negative

2357,US Airways,1,"""staff were just plain rude""","The US Airways flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia were fine and so was my domestic flight to Memphis. However, my return flight via Charlotte to London Heathrow, was a complete nightmare. We taxied to the run way on time to me told by the captain that a fault (which he said they knew about and should have already been fixed earlier that day) had occurred, it was nothing serious and we would go back to the stand for the system to be rebooted, then we would be on our way. Well, the reboot took place, pushed back from the stand to be told the fuel switch over light had come back on and we would have to return to the stand for engineers to take another look as reboot hadn't worked. Sat on stand for ages, then the captain said anyone who wished to leave the plane, to rearrange connecting flights, or to stretch their legs was welcome to do so and return to the plane at anytime. I was travelling with my disabled mother, but was worried as my father was due to travel 2hrs to collect us at Heathrow, and due to the time difference was about to leave her home in the UK. I asked a stewardess if it would be OK to leave my mom on the plane while I just step outside to make a call. Her words were ""no problem"". I left the plane and was told I had to go past the barriers at the departure gate, which I duly did. I managed to contact my father and asked the ground crew if I could return to the plane. The man was so rude and said no way, can't get back on the plane unless we tell you. I tried to explain that wasn't how it was told to us and I had my disabled mother onboard the aircraft, he shrugged his shoulder and walked away. I then noticed a woman staff member, who was talking to another couple, I waited at a distance, no saying a word as I didn't want to interrupt their conversation, but the women staff member turned to me and said, ""don't interrupt, I'll deal with you in a minute"". I was totally stunned at her attitude. Well, eventually I did get back on the plane but only after explaining about my mother and what the captain and stewardess had said. Eventually everyone was allowed back on board as we were told the plane had been fixed. Again we pushed back to be told fault had reappeared and engineers were going to replace a value. Again we were told it was fixed, pushed back, and, you guessed it, fault reappeared. This time we were told by the captain, even if the plane could be fixed a new crew would have to be found as they were now illegal to fly. This took place over 6hrs! One half filled cup of water and a packet of pretzels were given within those 6hrs. Then came the announcement, the flight was cancelled. Everyone got off, but my mother needed a wheelchair which took ages to come so by the time we got out to the departure gate we were last in the queue. Eventually given a flight home, 24hrs later, told couldn't get us a hotel as NASCAR was in town, given a cot to sleep on and $20 in food vouchers, but this was after midnight and no food outlets were open. When it was bought to the staff attention, the lukewarm food from the plane was given to us. My mother couldn't sleep in the cot provided so spent a sleepless night in her wheelchair.

From beginning to end, it was such a hassle for a 25 minute flight. At BWI, they insisted that you check in at a kiosk to obtain a boarding pass prior to check in. Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair, they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts, wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in, the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally, she relented, printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in.

2395,US Airways,1,US Airways customer review,"This was the most horrible experience. We were trying to leave BWI, when we got a phone call saying we were an hour delayed. Okay, it happens. Someone from the airline was checking the people with connecting flights to make sure they could still make it, he said we ""should"" make it. Well, we had a gut feeling ""should"" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte, they wouldn't pay, but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later, they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave, I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper), but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to ""maintenance"" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone, so my fiancé and I were upset). We sat there and of course, they say they have to change a tire that would take a bother 30 minutes. That whole trip ended up totaling 11 hours after delays, maintenance, and layover.

In any case, I wanted to get a refund for my ticket and you can't call and speak to anyone you have to fill out a form and wait 48 hours for someone to reach out to you. A  staff member finally text me. He was very nice and he processed my return. One day later, I realized that the card I originally used is cancelled. So I text back at that number and I got an automated message to fill out another form.

Flights have gone up in price since we booked, and they would not give us a refund that would cover the price of a new flight or book us on another flight the same day, which means we will lose money pre-paid on hotels and rental cars at our destination and have to pay out of pocket for the difference in a last-minute flight to get there.

Upon purchasing a small meal pack (I'm guessing the options were limited since it was only a 1.25 hour flight) and a cocktail, we were the last ones served (last seats on the plane). I feel as though delivering purchased products would be more of a priority. Perhaps assigning one person to deliver products while the other offers complimentary drinks would be more effective for customer service and efficiency. Maybe operationally that doesn't work for them because of cost but it compromises service. After receiving our order, the steward forgot an item and when I said excuse me and tried to tell her, she turned and said ""you have to wait"". I completely understand that but the way she said it was in a tone and look that I could only receive as annoyance. It was as if I was a nuisance to her. After reaching the back of the plane, I could hear loudly the other steward complaining and bad mouthing about a gentleman who wanted 2 diet cokes. I understand people talk shop but wow, in ear shot of other guests? We only received our purchases after the plane started to descend and before we knew it, we were forced to give up our purchased wine and cocktail. When my companion said ""I didn't even get to finish. I'm going to get a refund."" The steward retort with a ""you do that"". All I could think, and pardon the language, was ""what the heck?"". I have worked in customer service for over a decade, and this is by far the most unprofessional group of employees I have ever encountered. They were rude, unpleasant and just seemed so unhappy.

Thank you Virgin America, this worked out perfectly. Re ticketed in minutes, despite traveling on two different records. Given seats together in Main Cabin Select. Boarding was underway when we got to the gate, so we just walked right on board. We checked our bags, so no issue with lack of overhead space upon boarding. Left a few minutes late, then a 30 min ground hold, again due to SFO air traffic. Once in the air, choice of free food and beverages on this short 1 hr flight. Choose the protein snack with cheese and crackers and deli meats, which was excellent and would have not had a problem paying the $8 price tag, if we were in regular coach. I love the order online at our seat option. When the flight attendants get to your row, they simply hand you your choices. Very efficient. Landed 1 hr late in SFO, but still plenty of time for our connection. Spent 1.5 hrs in the Admirals Club, then a 3 hr flight to AUS, with again satisfying food options and beverages with a good choice of movies and shows to make the 3 hr flight time pass quickly. Would have liked to see a sandwich or salad offering on this sector, as the menu was the same as the short flight to SFO. Arrived on time, our bags were the 2nd ones off due to Priority Tags due to our status. Over all still a great airline that will be missed.

2441,Virgin America,6,"""not very service oriented""","Austin to San Francisco. The flight from to SFO was uneventful and I had a pretty good experience. The return flight not so much. In the end, the flight was 2.5 hours late into Austin. There was no issue with weather; it is still unclear why we had such a delay. Virgin did a very poor job of explaining it and really provided no information about the delay until after our flight was to have departed.  Once we pushed back from the gate, it took about 1 hour before we took off. Then, about 20 minutes after take-off, some people started to get up to use the rest room. They were quickly scolded since the fasten seat belt sign was still on. Once the pilot finally turned off the sign, about a dozen people jumped out of their seats and formed a long line for the restrooms at the back of the plane. I waited a while, and once the rest room in the front was unoccupied for a couple of minutes, I went up and used it. I was in row 5, so very near the front. As I returned to my seat, the flight attended reminded me that the rest room in the front was for first class. I said I understood that but there was a long line in the back and they had already had us on the plane for a couple of hours, so I had to do what I had to do. She scolded me some more and made me promise that I would not use the first class restroom for the remainder of the flight. Then another person from row 4 went to use the front rest room. She refused to let him and insisted that he join the long line in the back. On other flights, we have been told that it is also against the rules to form a long line for the rest rooms. When the crew came through for drinks, they gave mostly ice and only about 2/3 of a cup of soda.

However, JetBlue's times for San Francisco to Boston were not very compatible with our schedule, so we decided to fly Virgin America back. Check-in was fast, and before we knew it, we were at the gate with 1.5 hours before boarding. We went to a restaurant conveniently located next to the gate and returned with 15 minutes before boarding. Boarding went quickly too, and when we got on the plane, the cabin was lit up in deep purples and blues. I found that the entertainment was not quite as impressive as JetBlue's, but it was still good. The food selection could also have more variety. But those were not big problems, because the Gulfstream shortens the flight by an hour and were in Boston in 5.5 hours.

We arrive at the airport 2 hours before take off and the woman at the counter asks us where we're flying and we tell her. Her response is you're not flying tonight. I'm like what do you mean? She says airline policy is you to arrive 3 hours before. I explained what happened with the error message and she rolls her eyes and calls another employee. He says the same thing. I ask well what about the ticket we purchased, with insurance. He says not our problem and gives us the 800 number to try to resolve the issue. So we start calling at the airport. Then a guy came up to us and said to do the checkin in the app because he had just done it. So clearly the flight was not closed. I tried in the app again but no luck. No one answered after an hour waiting. We left the airport because her flight left. At home I kept calling and another 50 minutes without any answer. So I had to buy my mom another flight because she had to be there the next day for her brother's funeral. I called early morning to try to get help with the refund. And i asked about their policy about flight closing, she stated it closes 1 hour before. When I asked the insurance they said the reason for missed flight was not under the 27 clauses and that I should of called an hour before take off. I said I did but they didn't answer. I called the 800 line at the same time another day and no answer. When I spoke to a supervisor I asked him ""how am i at fault if their employees don't answer or do their job"" he rudely said they always answer the line.

2505,VivaAerobús,1,"""VivaAerobus flight was cancelled""","I purchased 2 tickets in Feb 2020 with VivaAerobús one for myself and the other for my hubby from March 23 through March 28. In March 2020, the COVID-19, pandemic was in full swing and by the time March 16, 2020 came around, our government made the call of having each individual state make decisions on closing down non-essential businesses. On top of this, there was a strict travel advisory concerning certain countries. I watched the news night and day trying to figure out if I should go because I also knew my bone graft procedure required a 5 to 6 month healing timeframe. I called my dental office in Cancun several times inquiring if there was any news from their administrators, I also watched news pertaining to Cancun, read news articles from Cancun and read numerous travel advisories from the US Dept of State concerning Cancun / Mexico. I was told that everything was a go by my dentist. I also kept calling my dental office, my hotel and finally VivaAerobus 1 week prior to departure to inquired what would occur if I should cancel due to the pandemic or if there had been any changes due to the pandemic that I need to be aware of. But Vivaaerobus customer service agents told me that my flight on March 23, 2020 had not been cancelled nor do they see of any future changes or cancellations for both my inbound or outbound flights. All 3 Vivaaerobus CSR agents who I spoke to prior to my departure on 3 different occasions each said the same thing including that “I would lose both of my airline fares for myself and my hubby and that I would not get a refund because it was a non refundable ticket. I explained to them that I did not want to get “stuck” in another country of course even if it’s Mexico but I was advised by these 3 CSR agents, that if my flight becomes delayed or cancelled, I could log onto the Vivaaerobus App and the updates would be there or that I could call the 1-800 number for Vivaaerobus and reach a CSR agent for further assistance if that occurred. I felt I had no choice and I didn’t want to lose our hard earned money so on March 23, 2020, my hubby & I went off on our trip. We had the Vivaaerobus App installed on both of our cell phones and we were able to check in and obtain our boarding pass 24 hours before our flight departed from Charlotte, NC. We were both hoping that after we got to the airport, that our flight would be cancelled so we could request a refund but it was not cancelled. The arrival/ departure screens at Charlotte Douglas Airport showed that our flight to Cancun was still scheduled and on time. We didn’t have any luggage to check on our flight only had 2 carry-ons. We made it to our gate 2 hours ahead of our 8:00 am flight and our plane was already parked at the gate. There was only 1 other passenger waiting for the flight. We boarded our outbound flight late, landed in Cancun safety. I concluded my dental appointment, constantly checked my VivaAerobus App for notifications none were provided by this airline. 10 hours before check in on March 27, 2020, the VivaAerobus App would not allow us to check in nor obtain our boarding passes. It showed an message which stated that we had to check in 2 hours before departure. We called and the 1-800 number but It was constantly busy, we sent emails/ inquiries through online chat to VivaAerobus but got NO RESPONSE. We decided to purchase a ticket with another airline.

2524,Volaris,1,"""this is how our system works""","My friends bought flights to come visit me. Volaris boasts of having cheaper flights but you have to pay for your seat and either have to pay for an upgraded ticket if you want baggage OR pay for your carrying on and checked baggage. If you have to cancel your flight (due to COVID for instance, which is what happened to my friends), they only give you vouchers for the flight costs (not seat, not baggage, not taxes, so you lose all that money). If you bought a round trip, they split the money you paid into one voucher for your flight to the location and one voucher for your flight back from the location so that they are equal amounts. When you go to buy your new flights (that you have to purchase within 90 days), you have to buy the flight there separately from the flight back. This means that if your flight there is more expensive than your voucher, you have to pay the difference (so my friends have to pay over 100$ extra each for a family of three for their flight to Mexico). If your flight back is cheaper than your voucher, you lose all of that money (which for my friends is more than 100$).

2527,Volaris,1,"""customer service is basically non-existent""","Volaris initially sold me on their flights due to their promise of ""lower"" prices. I even paid to upgrade my seats to the front of the plane and was excited to get a decent deal during a holiday. Upon my initial check in at the airport, the problems began. Volaris told me I had two sets of tickets, which I was unaware of (as I only received one email with one receipt!) I told them I only wanted one flight and the assistant said she would take care of it. She apparently did and we boarded the plane and vacationed. Upon our attempt to return, we were told there was no flight for us, as our tickets had been cancelled! Upon further review, it was found by a Volaris agent, that the prior assistant had cancelled the flight I had the paperwork on, and had left the other flight open. The issue is, the return flight was on different date that was a week prior to our scheduled return date, and which we knew nothing about! The agents in Guadalajara would not budge and since we have responsibilities, we had to get home and had to buy a subsequent return ticket. The agent assured us that the other ticket for a ""missed flight"" would be refunded by contacting customer service after we returned. Volaris customer service is basically non-existent and not of service. You can never get a live person on a phone line, unless you're buying a ticket. I used the email link, to which Volaris states will be responded to ""within 2 days"" - I've written three emails, each a week apart--and I have had no response! I sent a Messenger message and have gotten no response except an animated, antiquated number system sending me in a loop. I finally got a horrible response on Whatsapp that told me it was too late to request a refund, since I had ""accepted"" the initial flight and had ""missed"" the return flight. I should state here, that the return flight we repaid for, was not full, either! So here I sit with Volaris claiming there's nothing they can do---for their mistakes, which as cost me twice what I was originally paying! Thus, my flight has ended up costing me far more than any other airline would've in the first place. It's a scam! Volaris doesn't have low fares.

Because we had already scheduled time off work and school and hotels, cars, meeting others in Barcelona, we were forced to buy connections on Air France. WOW said they could get us as Paris so we had to purchase 5 round air tickets from CDG to BCN, lost 2 days of our vacation, lost a night in a hotel in BCN, had to pay for a hotel at CDG, spent almost 2 full days dealing with connections, layovers (extra costs for food, car etc) Then several days before our DTW to KEF flight, WOW air changed our airplane and scattered us all over the airplane (kids in middle seats in back etc). We were one of the first to book on the flight (Was empty at time) and had paid to purchase upgraded seats together/seats together. Wow did not honor seat assignments. spent close to 2 days on phone / email / twitter support with Wowair and AirFrance and hotels/car rental scheduling, rescheduling, getting seat assignments, seeking compensation. Wow cites an EU regulation that if cancel 2 weeks before, will offer no compensation; they slipped in just before 2 week window with cancelled flights. The staff was very nice but the company is just horrible. We were out approximately $2000 all in and no compensation or accommodation from company. Very sad because this was a long planned family trip that we had saved for and planned for a long time. The day we were flying, the company was offering ""free flights to people with the last name Valentine"". Very gimmicky and not taking care of their paying customers. Lastly, truly the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. It is a discount airline but so this is to be expected (though not at all discount when they screw you and cancel your flight). The economy / no upgrade seats are the most uncomfortable you could imagine, people were very miserable. Many families, could not move around at all. The first three rows were very large, like the people could do a pike/legs straight out. Makes no sense to give the upgraded seats too much room while the other 30 rows really suffered. The flights were packed and a lot of unhappy people. They charge for even water so the by the time you pay for water, food, definitely consider an upgrade, charges for luggage and if you are really unlucky - cancellation fees - you could fly first class with a reputable airline. Iceland is lovely but fly Delta or United or partners or anyone but Wowair. I read many many complaints on the internet etc. that they did this same behavior to many many other people.

2535,WOW air,1,"""I give them a poor rating""","We were scheduled to fly from Newark to Reykjavík and then from there to Dublin on WOW Air. As many know this company is low budget and a cheap way to get to Iceland and some major cities in Europe. We paid for upgrades seats so we weren’t cramped and also got the fare that included a carry on and a checked bag. While we were in the front of the plane if you don’t buy priority boarding passes it’s basically a free for all to board. At that point we sat on the plane and waited for two hours until they tried to figure out what was wrong with a “sensor” on the plane. They deplaned us after two hours. We sat in the terminal for another hour. After that. We waited and it was becoming clearer that we would not make our connecting flight to Dublin. No one on the ground knew the results and what would happen when we got to Iceland and with limited flights out of that airport the choice was do we wait out WOW or get on another flight in Newark on another airline at our cost. So ultimately WOW canceled our flight. As I was on the phone waiting on the phone I got a flight on Aer Lingus direct to Dublin and since WOW canceled our first flight they gave me the option. To cancel the whole round trip flight for my whole family. Which I did. They also said that they would credit me the money for our hotel to stay in Newark for a flight the next day. So I have to submit that claim later today. While I am paying more for my flight to Dublin now I’m not out the money to WOW as I have an e-mail confirmation of the flight cancellation and refund amount. So if they try to not refund me I can dispute the charges to my card. Some other notes the customer service people on the 800 number knew the flight was canceled before the people at the checkin desk. They also sorted me on to another plane 2 days later which would have really screwed me up for the trip. The day delay was not a super big deal. Also with limited options to Iceland I’d be careful booking tours in Iceland before you arrive. Folks were flying to Iceland and had these expensive tours booked and they were going to be out tons of money. While ultimately WOW made it right and I’ll get my money back I would not recommend them at all. However, with limited choices to Iceland if you must fly them to get there wait or give yourself an extra 24 hours before booking those expensive tours that might not refund you the money if you don’t get there. If you are just stopping over and connecting in Iceland to another destination with WOW Air pay more and get on one of the larger carriers. They have larger fleets to add flights and put you on other planes. The person at the WOW desk also was very clear that they have no relationships with other airlines. They won’t be able to get you on another flight out of your airport unless it’s a WOW flight.

I don’t mind no meal on a flight, not really a fan of airplane food anyway. I thought the connection seemed tight but it was what WOW advertised. So the flight out of Chicago was delayed. No reason was shared, no real info, it was just delayed by about 2 hours but the flight crew announced over the speaker on the plane. “They will hold your connections for you and we will make up time in the air”. Well that was a lie, don’t announce things that aren’t true. So once we got inside the airport multiple connecting flights were missed so there was a line 30-40 people long with 1 only, 1 WOW employee giving directions. Really WOW, you couldn’t do anything to assist all the passengers at that point? So after waiting 20-30 minutes in the line the lady tells me follow the arrivals signs and an agent will be waiting to direct you. Was there an agent, absolutely not. But I did find about 7 other passengers who were on the same connecting flight all wondering around lost wondering what was going on. We were able to piece together some info a few of us received different emails from WOW giving different info. By sharing with each other we realized we could book an airport hotel and they rebooked us on flights the next day. But not one of us had complete info and only by talking to each other could we piece this together. Finally after over an hour someone who worked at the airport, not WOW, got someone from WOW to speak to us and get a bus to take us to the hotel. We were told be ready for a bus to arrive by 3.30am in the morning to take us to the airport. Was there a bus nope, no bus. There were way more WOW stranded passengers at the hotel who arrived after us. The hotel called their shuttle service to come at 4am and take a huge bus full of all the passengers WOW stranded in Iceland and then again at the hotel. Huge thanks to Airport B&B.

Also, the seats were so crammed together my husbands knees were hitting the seat in front of us the whole time. He could not even put his tray down if he wanted to because of this. Why didn't we pay for extra leg room you ask? Well because we have not had this problem on any other flight we have flown.

No. It was only 20kg so we had to pull things out of our suitcase to get the weight down. Additionally,the lady checking us in was very rude and was talking about us in French with a very unpleasant look on her face. I am not fluent in French but body language says more than words. The check in attendant also first said that it would cost 10$ per kg over 20 and then after we took some things out she said it was 15$ because we needed to go to Chicago. Well of coarse we needed our bags to go all the way home. I also would  point out that whether our bags were under the plane or in the cabin, there is still the same amount of weight on the plane. Making us open all our luggage to save money in the airport is ridiculous. We were already frustrated and her changing information and being very rude and unprofessional did not help matters. We ended up paying $400 to get our luggage back on top of the $300 that we payed on the way there. This is the price of an extra airline ticket. This being said, we could have flown with ANY other airline and not have dealt with all the inconveniences. We are very upset with our flight experience on this trip.

2567,WOW air,1,"""a huge risk flying this airline""","Los Angeles to Reykjavik. The only reason I considered this airline is because it was the only direct flight and they had ""big seats,"" that we could upgrade to so I thought why not. We paid a lot extra to get the biggest seats, plus bags, meals etc. Well, the night before the flight, we check in and they have put us in standard seats with no extra legroom. They have four types of seats and they put us in the very smallest despite us paying several hundred dollars more per ticket for bigger seats. So, I call the customer service line and they just tell me that I will have to file a claim when I get back! So, my husband calls and they move our seats to what they say are bigger seats. Guess what? They were standard seats on the seat map. So, at that gate they start selling our seats that we already paid for as upgrades! So, my husband goes up and tries to find out why they are selling seats we already paid for and they just offer him some other seats that are supposedly XL but they are in the back of the plane. He says, we don't want seats that don't recline. They say they do recline. So, he agrees and they try to charge him again for an upgrade! Guess what? They are regular standard seats and they don't recline and for extra good measure the plug between the seats doesn't work on either row of seats that they put us in. This was on an overnight flight with my 8-year-old daughter. So, it comes to our return flight - same scenario. They put us in regular standard seats. We called the night before and my husband paid for another upgrade even though we already purchased their highest tier because he doesn't want to argue with them, we just wanted better seats. So, they move our seats, but when we get to the airport, they put us back in the regular standard seats! So, we spent the entire 3 hours at the airport trying to get better seats by talking to 3 different service desks, to no avail. We tell the crew when we get on the plane in case they have any extra decent seats and they offer us one free water. Plugs don't work on this flight either. Every single person we dealt with told us our seats were XL until I showed them the seat map and they will charge you for upgrades in seats that aren't upgrades at all. Everyone just said you'll have to file a claim. Guess what. When I filed a claim when we got back, they declined it and said that we had to contact customer service. Customer Service claimed that they don't deal with refunds. His message told me that I would have to go through an airline rights group. So, they basically tried to steal our money and make it as difficult as possible to get some of our money back. We never got our meals that we paid for or our seats. You are taking a huge risk flying this airline because even if they cancel your flight, you might not get your money back based on their customer service practices of denying legitimate claims.

Being the first to book WOW Premium on our travel dates, we did not expect three family members to be bumped down two classes of service – from Premium to Basic – and the other two members to be bumped from Premium to Plus. But, that’s what happened two days before departure. How do I know we booked first? Because the seat schematic in premium class was completely empty when we bought tickets 8 months before departure and selected our seats. Plane change was given as the reason, but the real reason was that WOW reconfigured their seats and classes of service, and didn’t notify anyone – at least not us. So instead of re-assigning seats according to booking dates or giving you the option of selecting new seats based on an early-booking priority, we were evidently randomly selected to downgrade even though we would have re-booked different dates had we been given more than 48-hours’ notice. The same thing happened on the way home. We were again bumped to lower service levels. On the way to Iceland, we at least received a few of the Premium perks, including a “meal” that consisted of a 10-inch baguette with two deli-thin slices of ham. But, this time, we were asked to show our receipts to the flight attendants in order to receive the meal and two drinks – one hot and one cold. Yes, that’s right, one hot and one cold. And we were informed that if we wanted two cold drinks we would have to pay for one, even if we were to forego the hot drink. Our luggage arrived with us on the flight to Iceland. It also made it home, which we were happy to discover after a suspenseful, 40-minute wait at St. Louis’ baggage claim. Others weren’t so lucky. At least a half-dozen passengers mentioned that their luggage had been lost. Some on a non-stop flight; others on a connection through Reykjavik to and from Europe. One individual was on his way home after two weeks in Europe; he still hadn’t received his suitcase. Another person mentioned that her luggage never made it onboard the non-stop flight to Iceland. Then, when it did arrive, WOW refused to deliver the bags. They kept them at the airport until her week-long tour returned for the trip back to the States. Fly WOW if cost-savings are paramount and you’re willing to chance the service for the savings. Seats are really small, unless you upgrade.

2577,Xiamen Airlines,2,"""they are a 3rd rate airline""","Seattle to Manila via Xiamen. My wife and I planned a trip to the Philippines from Seattle and decided upon Xiamen Airlines Business Class. The routing was Seattle, Shenzen, Xiamen and Manila. We traveled late October 2018. The seating configuration in the Boeing 787, Business Class was 2-2-2. The seats were lay flat for sleeping, but unfortunately were leatherette covered which meant one would slide forward when seated upright due to the slippery covering. Lunch was served and I chose duck. This was the consistency of rubber and virtually inedible. The 12.5 hour flight was uneventful, however during this time the cabin staff barely checked on us. When they did, there was a distinct language problem. We couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand us! One would think when one is on a international flight a common understandable language should be used. When we arrived at Shenzen we had a layover of 2 hours during which time we had to clear Chinese Customs and Immigration. After this we had to wait in a departure lounge without being told anything about our next flight leg. There were about 12 onward passengers waiting for the next leg. Eventually we were told our boarding gate and ETD. The flight to Xiamen was around 1 hour. After arrival we had to pick up our luggage and we went to the Xiamen Airlines counter to get a hotel voucher as we had 20 hour layover. Xiamen Airlines to not have a hotel bus or any means to transport us to the hotel. We had to change money to get a taxi. This was an effort in its own right. We did leave some of our baggage at the left luggage office at the airport, which helped. The next day we caught a taxi back to the airport. We go through security on entry to the airport before checking in for our flight to Manila. I should mention that boarding to Manila like the short leg for Shenzen was chaos. No boarding by class or seating, just go for it! Service on board was almost like a domestic flight, again a language problem. We arrive in Manila after almost 36 hours after leaving Seattle. It was nice to experience the friendliness of Philippine Customs and Immigration. The return from Manila to Seattle every bit as bad as when we arrived late (11:30pm) in Xiamen we had to clear customs and immigration and by the time that happened it was around 2am banks were closed and we had now money for a taxi to the hotel we finally change $20 with a Xiamen Airline staff member and got to the hotel around 2:30 am. We were again routed via Shenzen and had to go through immigration and carry ALL bags through security. The flight back was slightly better, but there was still the language barrier.

I booked a flight from Los Angeles to Bangkok with three hours layover in Xiamen city. At the airport I was told that I can’t use Xiamen airlines because I don’t have Chinese transit visa. Xiamen airport does not have transit area for transit passengers so everyone has to go through customs, get out of the airport, and then walk back in to check in for the next flight. Be advised, you can’t get out of the airport unless you have Chinese visa. I have never heard that you need to get a transit visa for couple of hours layover. I was told to cancel my round trip with Xiamen airlines and get a refund. After 6-7 hrs of phone calls with the airline, I was issued 15% refund of the total cost. The agent explained that somehow my outbound ticket was activated (I flew with a different airline but they still activated my ticket!) and the “activated” ticket was 85% of the cost and I’m only getting 15% refund for the return flight.

2580,Xiamen Airlines,1,"""new and fresh airline""","Los Angeles to Seoul via Xiamen. We booked this airline because 3 of us could go round trip for the price of 1 major carrier! Such a deal - R/T LAX to ICN (Seoul Korea) for $450 per person!  If you are not Asian or don't like Asian food - please pack your own food. Found this airline to be just as professional, efficient, and friendly to fly with. Our flight did have to go thru 2 Chinese ports of entry (Qingdao & Xiamen). The flight was very comfortable due to the new airplane (Boeing 787-9). I noticed the increased air pressure (6000 ft elevation) and increased humidity did not dry me out and felt good at the end of 14 hours in flight. The flight staff was very courteous, attentive, and tried their best with English but Google translate came in handy to communicate. Wifi was available but not very good - too many people using it and not enough bandwidth for streaming. Food was good - 2 hot meals and 2 cold snacks in-between kept you full and satisfied. Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can ""transit"" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency. We got to also go on a tour of the city on a double decker sightseeing bus that took us all around the perimeter of the island. Overall, a very nice new and fresh airline to fly with for many Asian countries.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,5/1/2018,5,5,5,5,5,1,Los Angeles,Seoul,True,South Korea,False,International,lo angel seoul via xiamen book airlin 3 us could go round trip price 1 major carrier deal rt lax icn seoul korea 450 per person asian n't like asian food pleas pack food found airlin profession effici friendli fli flight go thru 2 chines port entri qingdao xiamen flight comfort due new airplan boe 7879 notic increas air pressur 6000 ft elev increas humid dri felt good end 14 hour flight flight staff courteou attent tri best english googl translat came handi commun wifi avail good mani peopl use enough bandwidth stream food good 2 hot meal 2 cold snack inbetween kept full satisfi chines cuisin 4 leg flight 2 intern 2 domest rememb airlin chines therefor serv chines food n't expect panda express type food like us food primarili pork base fish chicken beef offer elect vegetarian muslim special need food make sure request 24 hour flight saw western folk unhappi see unfamiliar chines food serv chines airlin chuckl watch eat bread desert meal issu airlin 's fault go thru chines immigr chines visa normal requir land china 50 countri transit thru china prove final destin outsid china govern issu temporari transit visa go thru countri 's good 24 hour 2 hr layov refuel qingdao worst scrutin held entir non chines group passeng look error past problem pull 2 passeng group fail regist local chines polic agenc last time china militari uniform peopl surround make feel like communist countri airlin staff good prepar chines immigr itinerari board pass correct name spell etc land xiamen much easier nicer immigr folk even time visit first class airport loung use amex plat card return trip good even overnight layov airlin provid hotel night cost nice pay taxi ride way rememb bring chines yuan rmb currenc got also go tour citi doubl decker sightse bu took us around perimet island overal nice new fresh airlin fli mani asian countri,0.96,0.153088688,Positive,Positive

2583,Xiamen Airlines,6,"""worst part was the layover in Xiamen""","Los Angeles to Bangkok via Xiamen. It was not the overly-friendly skies, especially on the shorter flight, but the snacks, food and beverage were OK. Another review reminded me of the barely audible English announcements (use headphones to hear it). The seats and legroom seem average. The Boeing 787 for the LAX-XMN segment is a nice, new aircraft. The entertainment system had a small selection of music and movies, which were adequate. Emirates scores better there! The website is hard to use, and changes seemed impossible. But I successfully purchased a ticket. If I purchased again, I would be certain everything is perfect before clicking Submit. I'm hesitant to call ""customer service"" as English is not their main language, and rules over customer satisfaction seem to be the situation. The worst part of the flight was the layover in Xiamen, China. Border control entry is required, followed by departure control. This is slow and time consuming. Re-entering security is very strict. Every passenger is wanded after passing the magnetometers. My baggage scan revealed two small Bic lighters, which were confiscated. Any lithium batteries in checked bags are likely to be removed. The airport is years behind many International airports, and is hard to spend time in. However, long layovers can qualify you for a hotel room (+5 hours), a city tour, or the lounge on the lowest level - with free Wi-Fi. The lounge was quite basic and drab. Hard to call it a ""benefit"". A room in the back had cots. In the airport, I was twice offered working iPhones for cash. With a landing announcement that mentions contacting quarantine if you're ill, including headaches, nausea or diarrhea, and the scrutiny upon entry and exit, I don't advise buying black market iPhones. The ticket price was very competitive.

A safety card, two magazines and a menu in the pocket; a blanket and a bottle of water on the seat. But the menu missed a translation for breakfast. The food is not bad but can be improved. The crew were trying to act as friendly, but lacked some sincereness, but they did a great job. Their English skill really needs improvement.  As a Chinese airline they followed the CAAC rule, which restricted people to use their laptops and other devices only when the aircraft reached cruising attitude and didn't allow passengers to switch on their phones at all.

Super cheap tickets, lack of information before and during trip, some airport confusion if you're really out of it or don't speak Chinese. They provide a hotel if flying all legs of trip on Xiamen Airlines with overnight layover, entertainment and food caters to Chinese tastes. I speak Mandarin, so I rate this flight a 8/10. Screaming deal of a ticket booked in 12/2016. Super nervous after receiving email in January 2017 of seat cancellation for the first leg of my trip (Seattle-Shenzhen). Customer service doesn't speak English. Got a call back in Chinese (my Chinese is ok, but not my first language) and took about 30 minutes plus another 30 minute call back to realize that the seat No I requested was cancelled and not the seat on the flight.  Over next few months, received a few more e-mails stating that flight times had changed, even though they were the same as when we booked them. Still felt insecure about whether or not our trip would really happen.  No online check-in for foreigners. We show up at the airport and have an easy check-in. Heard that Xiamen Air provides a hotel which the airport staff confirmed.  Arrived at Shenzhen to some chaos - they separate the transfers passengers, people are confused as to where to go, but are shepherded by the Xiamen air staff. Waited about 45 minutes with several other foreigners to get my boyfriend's 24-hour transit visa which allows him to leave the airport. Disembarked at Xiamen, shepherded again by the staff to pick up our baggage. Many of the foreign passengers did not know about the hotel that Xiamen air provided us with, since we all arrived around 9pm and had connecting flights in the morning. They expected to sleep on the floor of the airport. Followed signs to the reception desk that makes lodging arrangements. Showed our passports and tickets and provided with a room at the E-Charm Hotel in Xiamen. If you are travelling alone, they will pair you with someone of the same gender. The hotel is about 10 minutes away from the airport and costs about 15 RMB one way. Although the room provided was free, we had to cover our travel expense both ways to and from the hotel. I think this is strange. If you are only going to and from the hotel, the cash machines up on level 2 allow you to take out 100 RMB. Hotel was nice for Chinese standards!
